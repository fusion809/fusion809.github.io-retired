A {% include wp.html f="b" art="Semi-presidential_system" link="semi-presidential system" %} is a republican system of government wherein some executive power is vested in a popularly elected president, but most of it is vested in a separate head of government (HoG; prime minister or chancellor is their usual title) that heads the cabinet. The HoG and other members of the cabinet are held accountable to the legislature, which like in parliamentary systems is often referred to as the parliament. There are two main basic subtypes of semi-presidential system presently in use:

1. **President-parliamentary systems** (PPMS), wherein the HoG and the rest of the cabinet can be dismissed by the president. These systems usually also give the president the ability to dissolve the parliament at will, with no limits on how often this can be done. These systems are usually seen as the worst of the two, in terms of their long-term stability and overall functioning.
2. **Premier-presidential systems** (PMPS), wherein the HoG cannot be dismissed by the president. The rest of the cabinet can sometimes be dismissed by the president, usually only on the advice of the HoG. In such systems the president usually cannot dissolve the parliament, and if they can there are usually well-defined limits on this. For example, in {% include wp.html link="France" %} the {% include wp.html art="President_of_the_French_Republic" link="President" %} can dissolve the {% include wp.html art="National_Assembly_(France)" link="National Assembly" %} (lower house of their {% include wp.html art="French_Parliament" link="Parliament" puncr=")" %} only once during their term.
