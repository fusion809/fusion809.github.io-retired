A {% include wp.html f="b" art="Semi-presidential_system" link="semi-presidential system" %} is a republican system of government wherein some executive power is vested in a popularly elected president, but most of it is vested in a separate head of government (HoG; prime minister or chancellor is their usual title) that heads a cabinet. The HoG and other members of the cabinet are held accountable to the legislature, which like in parliamentary systems is usually referred to as a parliament. Semi-presidential systems can be further classified according to the relationship between the president, the HoG and the cabinet:

1. systems wherein the president can dismiss the HoG and other members of the cabinet are referred to as **president-parliamentary systems** (PPMS); while
2. systems wherein the president cannot dismiss the HoG, but may be able to dismiss other members of the cabinet, are referred to as **premier-presidential systems** (PMPS). 

In PMPS, usually the president cannot dissolve the parliament, although in the case of {% include wp.html link="France" %} the {% include wp.html art="President_of_the_French_Republic" link="President" %} can dissolve the {% include wp.html art="National_Assembly_(France)" link="National Assembly" %} (lower house of their {% include wp.html art="French_Parliament" link="Parliament" puncr=")" %} only once during their term. In PMPS, usually the president can dissolve the parliament as often and whenever they want.
