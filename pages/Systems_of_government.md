This article is more for my benefit than anyone else's, it is mostly so that I can write my thoughts and knowledge on the various systems of government. A recent interest of mine has been systems of government.

Systems of government
=====================

{% include_relative governance/image-with-caption.html text="Figure 2: Basic forms of government" subtext="Click map or legend to view the full form, which includes hyperlinks for countries and government types." img="https://fusion809.github.io/images/Maps/Forms of government (shorter desc; more descriptive).svg" width="100%" %}

<!-- Definitions -->
{% include h2.html text="Definition" %}

The two main basic types of government in use around the world today are {% include wp.html link="monarchies" f="b" %} and {% include wp.html link="republics" f="b" puncr="." %} Neither of which have a perfect, universally agreed upon definition. Their definition has evolved significantly over time. The first definition I give will be my own, based on commonalities between all countries that call themselves monarchies or republics. 

Under a monarchy, the head of state&mdash;the monarch&mdash;is an individual who usually inherits their role, and usually cannot be forcibly removed from their role, except due to incapacity. Historically, it was taken for granted that this monarch would have absolute power to do with whatever they please, but over the centuries this definition has changed radically with many countries adopting greater restrictions on their monarch's power. 

A republic is essentially every other type of government. The word "republic" derives from the Latin meaning "public thing", which means that the governance of the country is meant to be a public matter, not the private concern of the rulers. Despite this, many republics are not as democratic as this definition makes them sound, e.g. {% include wp.html link="North Korea" puncr="'s" %} official name is "Democratic People's Republic of Korea", despite it not being democratic at all (although I have read that "mock" elections are held).

<!-- Monarchy -->
<!-- Heading, without the box around it-->
{% include h2.html text="Monarchies" %}

Under monarchy there are three main basic types:

* {% include wp.html art="Absolute_monarchy" link="Absolute" f="b" %} (**AM**)&mdash;where the monarch has absolute power over every aspect of government. These were once more commonplace than they are now, as if the monarch abuses this power enough (which usually eventually happens) they are often removed forcibly by a {% include wp.html link="coup d'état" puncr="" %} and the system of government is often changed, either to a republic or a more limited monarchy. {% include wp.html link="Saudi Arabia" %} and {% include wp.html link="Oman" %} are two notable examples of absolute monarchies that still exist today.

* {% include wp.html f="b" art="Constitutional_monarchy" link="Parliamentary constitutional" %} (**PCM**)&mdash;where the monarch has mostly ceremonial powers and most of the country's governance is done via democratic means. Notable examples of this include {% include wp.html link="Commonwealth realms" art="Commonwealth_realm" %}, several other European monarchies (e.g. the {% include wp.html link="Netherlands" %} and {% include wp.html link="Norway" puncr=")," %} {% include wp.html link="Japan" %} and {% include wp.html link="Malaysia" %}.

* **Dual system constitutional** (**DSCM**)&mdash;where the monarch retains significant power, but there is still a parliament (often fairly weak) and constitutional limits on the monarch's power. The most notable example of this is {% include wp.html link="Morocco" puncr="." %}

    If one goes purely by what the constitution of Commonwealth realms says one would also have to consider Commonwealth realms as DSCMs, as they vest complete executive power in the monarch or their representative, along with some legislative powers (e.g. the power to give assent or not to legislation). Despite this, theoretical power, the monarch/their representative almost always acts in accordance with the advice of elected officials, so in practice Commonwealth realms function more as PCMs.

{% include wp.html link="Thailand" %} is a PCM that has had its constitutional provisions for governance suspended and is presently under {% include wp.html link="military dictatorship" puncr="." %}

<!-- Republic -->
<!-- Heading, without the box around it-->
{% include h2.html text="Republics" %}

Republics come in several different flavours (and yes, some republics have multiple different applicable adjectives) including:

<!-- Islamic -->
* {% include wp.html art="Islamic republic" link="Islamic" f="b" %}&mdash;republics ruled by Islamic laws. There are, at the time of writing, four Islamic republics in the world:

    - {% include wp.html link="Afghanistan" %}&mdash;follows a presidential system.
    - {% include wp.html link="Iran" %}&mdash;unique governance system that most closely resembles a presidential system.
    - {% include wp.html link="Mauritania" %}&mdash;otherwise government as a semi-presidential republic.
    - {% include wp.html link="Pakistan" %}&mdash;otherwise it is governed in a similar way to India, with a parliament vested with executive and legislative power and a separate judiciary.

<!-- Presidential -->
* {% include wp.html f="b" art="Presidential_system" link="Presidential" %}&mdash;systems in which there is a popularly elected president that is both head of state and head of government, and there is a separate, largely independent legislature that is overseen by other elected officials (e.g. senators and congresspersons). The legislature has fairly minimal ability to affect the executive branch and vice versa, except via use of powers that are designed to only be used in exceptional circumstances (e.g. the legislature can often impeach the president, but it is challenging, likewise the president has the ability to veto any legislation that is pending approval). High ranking members of the judiciary are often appointed by the president, with the consent of the senate. The US is the prototypical presidential republic.

    They tend to be relatively unstable, rank less well on measures of democracy (e.g. look at Turkey and Zimbabwe) and often end in a coup d'état, because of the difficulty in removing an unruly president and the difficulty in passing legislation when the president's political views differ from those of the legislature.

<!-- Semi-presidential -->
* {% include wp.html f="b" art="Semi-presidential system" link="Semi-presidential" %}&mdash;systems where executive power is vested in both a popularly elected fixed term president and a cabinet (which includes its leader, the prime minister/premier/chancellor, whom I will simply refer to as PM). The president appoints members of the cabinet (ministers), on the advice of the PM (who the president also appoints), but they are responsible to the legislature. The PM is usually a member of the legislature, but is not necessarily. 

    Whether the president can dismiss the PM or not depends greatly on the specific subtype of semi-presidential system in question&mdash;under the **premier-presidential** system they cannot, while under **president-parliamentary** systems they can. Under this system the president is mostly concerned with foreign policy and defence, while the PM deals largely with domestic policy. France is the prototypical semi-presidential (specifically premier-presidential) republic, while Russia and the Weimar Republic that preceded Nazi Germany are noted examples of president-parliamentary systems. 

    They seem to be particularly easy to abuse and turn into a dictatorship as they are present in countries that rank consistently near the bottom on measures of democracy (e.g. DRC, Russia), and was present in the {% include wp.html link="Weimar Republic" puncr="," %} which preceded {% include wp.html link="Nazi Germany" puncr="." %}

<!-- Parliamentary -->
* {% include wp.html art="Parliamentary_republic" link="Parliamentary" f="b" %}&mdash;this is a common type of republic in Europe, wherein the legislative and executive branches are fused, as members of the executive branch are usually also members of legislature and are responsible to the legislature (which is called "parliament"). Many former PCMs that are now republics are parliamentary republics, which is the case for:

    - {% include wp.html link="Botswana" %}
    - {% include wp.html link="India" %}
    - {% include wp.html link="Fiji" %}
    - {% include wp.html link="Iceland" %}
    - {% include wp.html link="Ireland" %}
    - {% include wp.html link="Myanmar" %}
    - {% include wp.html link="South Africa" %}

    Usually the executive head of government is called the prime minister and there is a largely ceremonial president (that basically serves the same roles as the Governor/Governor-General does in a PCM), but there are some such countries where the president is the head of government and there is no prime minister (e.g. Botswana, South Africa). When the president is ceremonial usually they are popularly elected (either directly, or by an electoral college), while if they are executive they are usually appointed by, and responsible to, the parliament.

<!-- Directorial -->
* {% include wp.html f="b" art="Directorial system" link="Directorial" %}&mdash;these are rare systems, of which there is only one, maybe two, modern examples ({% include wp.html link="Switzerland" %} for certain, {% include wp.html link="San Marino" %} is a disputed example), they are somewhat similar to parliamentary systems with an executive presidency in that their executive leadership is named by the parliament. The difference is that more than one person (2 for San Marino, 7 for Switzerland) jointly serves as both head of state and head of government and has equal authority. They jointly make decisions and serve for fixed terms and cannot be removed prematurely by the parliament. Usually these leaders are of different parties as well. 

<!-- One-party -->
* {% include wp.html f="b" art="One-party system" link="One-party" %}&mdash;these are usually Marxist-Leninist states, like what was present in the {% include wp.html link="USSR" art="Soviet_Union" puncr="," %} and is now in place in {% include wp.html link="China" puncr="," %} {% include wp.html link="Vietnam" %} and {% include wp.html link="Laos" puncr="." %} They are authoritarian states wherein all, or almost all, authority is vested in a single political party, which is the only party that legally can be in charge. These parties usually hold to a single ideology and if they are {% include wp.html link="Marxist-Leninist" %} their stated goal is to one day achieve Marxist communism. They do this by imposing state capitalism, wherein most businesses are state-owned and operated for the state's profit so that they can develop their capitalist economy and create a state of abundance. Under Marxist thought communism can only be achieved in a state of abundance and this is why they implement state capitalism despite claiming to be socialist. China's economy is presently the second fastest growing in the world after India and has not experienced negative growth (i.e. a recession) since the 1970s and their GDP (PPP) is presently the highest in the world.

<!-- Socialist -->
* {% include wp.html f="b" art="Socialist_state" link="Socialist" %}&mdash;these are nations that are officially, that is constitutionally, dedicated to the establishment of {% include wp.html link="socialism" puncr="." %} Many such countries are also one-party states, but not all are. Examples of at least {% include wt.html link="nominally" art="nominal" %} democratic states that are also socialist by this definition include, but are not limited to: {% include wp.html link="Bangladesh" puncr="," %} {% include wp.html link="Guyana" puncr="," %} {% include wp.html link="India" %} and {% include wp.html link="Tanzania" puncr="." %}

Organizational structure
========================

<!-- Federal vs Unitary states map -->
{% include_relative governance/image-with-caption.html text="Figure 1: Federal and unitary states of the world" img="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Map_of_unitary_and_federal_states.svg" width="100%" %}

<!-- Federation definition -->
{% include h2.html text="Federation" %} 
Some countries comprise a union of many smaller partially self-governing regions under a central federal government; such countries are referred to as {% include wp.html art="Federation" link="federal states" f="b" %} (**federations**). These partially self-governing regions may be called, among other things, states, cantons or provinces. 

Federations differ in their level of: 

1. {% include wp.html link="Centralization" art="Centralized_government" %} of powers&mdash;whether most power is held by the federal government or by the subnational governments. This more exists as a spectrum, with Canada and the former USSR being more centralized than Australia or the US. 

2. {% include wp.html link="Symmetry" art="Symmetric_federalism" %} in authority&mdash;whether all subnational entities are treated equally, such as in terms of their autonomy. The Russian Federation is an example of an asymmetric federation, wherein some federal subjects have greater autonomy and powers than others. Australia and the US are examples of symmetric federations. 

3. Duality, whether the subnational and federal governments work in concert ({% include wp.html link="cooperative" art="Cooperative_federalism" %}) or fairly independently ({% include wp.html link="dual" art="Dual_federalism" %}), with clearly defined boundaries on their respective powers. Australia is an example of a dual federation, whereas the US is an example of a cooperative federation. 

<!-- Unitary state definition -->
{% include h2.html text="Unitary state" %}
The main alternative type of country is referred to as a {% include wp.html link="unitary state" f="b" %}, where there is a national government that has ultimate authority in the land. Unitary states that voluntarily delegate some self-governance to subnational (e.g. provincial) governments are referred to as {% include wp.html art="Devolution" link="devolved states" f="b" puncr="," %} with a classic example being the {% include wp.html link="United Kingdom" puncr="," %} and its self-governing regions of {% include wp.html link="Wales" puncr="," %} {% include wp.html link="Northern Ireland" %} and {% include wp.html link="Scotland" puncr="." %} This self-governance the national government has delegated away to subnational governments can be unilaterally revoked, or lessened (e.g. laws can be overruled). Other notable examples of devolved states include:

* {% include wp.html link="France" %}
* {% include wp.html link="Indonesia" %}&mdash;when it achieved independence from the Netherlands in 1949 it agreed to become a federation (at the request of the Netherlands), but the Indonesians feared this was an attempt to weaken the nation, make it more susceptible to being retaken by the Dutch, as part of a divide and conquer strategy. So a year later it became a unitary state, but with devolved powers. 
* {% include wp.html link="South Africa" %}
* {% include wp.html link="Spain" %}

In Spain's case while these devolved powers can theoretically be unilaterally revoked, the process is unclear and likely quite challenging, so hence it is probably as close to a federation as a devolved state can get. 

<!-- Confederation -->
{% include h2.html text="Confederation vs. federation" %}
{% include wp.html link="Confederation" f="b" %} are another organizational structure arrangement wherein sovereign nations voluntarily, usually by means of a treaty, agree to join together for the purpose of achieving common goals (e.g. defence against a common enemy) or for mutual benefit (e.g. for freer trade). The distinction made between a confederation and a federation has evolved over time. Once upon a time the two terms were used interchangeably, but nowadays confederations are usually taken to mean:

* A fully voluntary union between sovereign states; by voluntary, I mean they are fully able to {% include wt.html link="secede" %} from the union, should they choose.
* The glue that joins the member states together, the confederal government, is usually quite weak and easily dissolved. 
* The states are given a great degree of autonomy, and only voluntarily give up some powers to the confederal government. 
* The confederal government is answerable and subordinate to those of the member states.

While in federations the initial choice to form a union is usually voluntary, but once the union is formed usually the member states have minimal ability to secede. If they can secede the procedure is often complicated and requires federal cooperation. In federations, the federal government is usually significantly stronger than a confederal government, with more powers that cannot be unilaterally lessened by the state governments. The federal government is often quite difficult (but not impossible, cf. the USSR) to dissolve. In federations, states usually have no real sovereignty and are generally treated as subordinate (e.g. federal laws usually prevail over state laws, if there are any inconsistencies).
