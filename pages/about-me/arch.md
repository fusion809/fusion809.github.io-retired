Manjaro Linux is a beginner-friendly derivative of Arch Linux, a Linux distribution based on the "Keep It Simple, Stupid" (KISS) principle, that is geared towards more experienced Linux users. The way it interprets the KISS principle, is that a fresh Arch install should be the barebones and that automation (e.g. there is no automated installer for Arch, by default) should be kept to a minimum. For this reason, Arch Linux was previously out of my reach, until I found some scripts for automating its installation process. Unfortunately, installing Arch on my removable drive did not go well at first (I forgot to install and configure a boot loader for it, I think), so I then opted to use Manjaro Linux in its place on this drive.

Later I managed to install Arch Linux on this removable drive and successfully boot it and then I successfully installed it on my internal hard drive (namely on my {% include Layouts/path.html path="/dev/sda3" %} partition, with {% include Layouts/path.html path="/dev/sda1" %} being my Sabayon partition and {% include Layouts/path.html path="/dev/sda2" %} being my swap partition). Graphics issues caused me to delete this internal drive installation and install OT in its place. Later I deleted this installation and installed Arch in its place. Manjaro Linux uses its own repositories, which are updated approximately once a week, this is apparently to ensure the system's stability.
