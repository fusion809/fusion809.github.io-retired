I successfully installed Gentoo Linux around early April 2017 and with what I learnt from installing Funtoo Linux I found it fairly easy. I ended up switching my init system from OpenRC to systemd and using git to control my local Portage tree copy (as opposed to the default of rsync). Around late April 2017 my hard disk on which Gentoo was installed crashed and I had to re-install it. Took about two days to set up a basic, usable system with a GUI (namely KDE Plasma). I learnt that a Gentoo (testing) is quite buggy, mostly with respect to building packages. I found myself filing at least one bug report per day, until my system was fully set up (which took roughly a fortnight), with all the packages I wanted.

I have also tried musl and runit, both musl and runit together and runit by itself, in it. They were a bit of work but I managed to get them to work, with help, of course.
