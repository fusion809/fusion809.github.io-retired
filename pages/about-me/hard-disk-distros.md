</div>

I have also tried Android-x86 6.0/7.1-rc2/7.1, Peppermint OS 8 (20171130), RemixOS 3.0, ROSA R10 (only in live session as the installer crashed on me), Ubuntu 17.10, Ubuntu Kylin 17.10 (installer crashed on me too, as it was expecting to run grub-install and I was going to use another distribution's GRUB to boot it) in live sessions.
