Mint 18.3 started fine, thanks to its Ubuntu base it was easy to set up Broadcom wireless in the live session, even without inserting an ethernet cable as the required packages were already in the package cache. I disliked the outdated software though (but it is something it shares with Ubuntu LTS and is needed for its stability so it is not something I hold against it personally) and I hear distribution upgrades between major releases (e.g. 16.x, 17.x, 18.x, etc.) often causes major breaks. I also experienced some weird bugs with the Cinnamon applet installer. I only used it for a few hours though before I gave up.
