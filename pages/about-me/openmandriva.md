Started fine and I did not notice any stability issues, although its packages were more bleeding edge than Mageia at least. Found it odd that a distribution with the word 'open' in its name would include a nonfree repository (containing things like Broadcom drivers) by default. Felt like its Broadcom wireless drivers package was barely being maintained though. I installed it and got errors mentioned in [this forum thread](https://forum.openmandriva.org/t/dkms-broadcom-wl-a-missing-file-dkms-was-expecting-and-erroneous-sed-command/1550), an earlier (by less than 2 months) [thread](https://forum.openmandriva.org/t/cant-configure-my-wireless/1477) relating to this package, [another in Italian](https://forum.openmandriva.org/t/omv-i586-32-aggiornata-a-3-02-non-collega-il-wifi-scambia-linterfaccia-wifi-per-interfaccia-ethernet/1207) and a [fourth in French](https://forum.openmandriva.org/t/la-lx3-0-rc1-est-arrivee/555) with all but the French one being within the past six months (as of 11 December 2017), indicates to me that maybe this package is less maintained on OpenMandriva Lx than on other distributions, or maybe just plain buggy. To be clear this is not me biting at its developers, I realize they owe me and everyone else nothing, just commenting on my impressions and experience. So I essentially gave up on this interesting distribution that for me is best used only in a virtual machine.
