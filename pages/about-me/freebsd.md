I successfully installed FreeBSD on my first go, so it was not so difficult. My main qualm with it, the main reason it ranks so lowly, is because its hardware support is not as good as Linux's. I installed FreeBSD 11.2 to an old laptop of mine (from ~2011, 4 GB RAM and 2 i5 CPUs), mostly because I did not want to risk destroying the data on my main laptop, but partly also because its hardware was the most compatible with Linux (WiFi drivers came pre-installed with Ubuntu as they were open-source), so I was hoping it would also be compatible with FreeBSD 11.2. Sadly, its WiFi chip was not compatible with it, but otherwise things went largely fine. 

I installed the i3 (did not want to install KDE Plasma 4 as it only had 4 GB RAM and 2 cores so odds are Plasma 4 would run, just slowly) window manager, tried to set it up with my Debian configs, after a little installing of software I got it to start, but the i3 status bar configs I had did not work so well on FreeBSD. The configs used i3pystatus, which makes seems to assume the host system is Linux.
