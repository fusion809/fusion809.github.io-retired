{% include h2.html text="Federation" %} 
Some countries comprise a union of many smaller partially self-governing regions under a central federal government; such countries are referred to as {% include wp.html art="Federation" link="federal states" f="b" %} (**federations**). These partially self-governing regions may be called, among other things, states, cantons or provinces. 

Federations differ in their level of: 

1. {% include wp.html link="Centralization" art="Centralized_government" %} of powers&mdash;whether most power is held by the federal government or by the subnational governments. This more exists as a spectrum, with Canada and the former USSR being more centralized than Australia or the US. 

2. {% include wp.html link="Symmetry" art="Symmetric_federalism" %} in authority&mdash;whether all subnational entities are treated equally, such as in terms of their autonomy. The Russian Federation is an example of an asymmetric federation, wherein some federal subjects have greater autonomy and powers than others. Australia and the US are examples of symmetric federations. 

3. Duality, whether the subnational and federal governments work in concert ({% include wp.html link="cooperative" art="Cooperative_federalism" %}) or fairly independently ({% include wp.html link="dual" art="Dual_federalism" %}), with clearly defined boundaries on their respective powers. Australia is an example of a dual federation, whereas the US is an example of a cooperative federation.
