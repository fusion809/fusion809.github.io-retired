{% include h2.html text="Unitary state" %}
The main alternative type of country is referred to as a {% include wp.html link="unitary state" f="b" %}, where there is a national government that has ultimate authority in the land. Unitary states that voluntarily delegate some self-governance to subnational (e.g. provincial) governments are referred to as {% include wp.html art="Devolution" link="devolved states" f="b" puncr="," %} with a classic example being the {% include wp.html link="United Kingdom" puncr="," %} and its self-governing regions of {% include wp.html link="Wales" puncr="," %} {% include wp.html link="Northern Ireland" %} and {% include wp.html link="Scotland" puncr="." %} This self-governance the national government has delegated away to subnational governments can be unilaterally revoked, or lessened (e.g. laws can be overruled). Other notable examples of devolved states include:

* {% include wp.html link="France" %}
* {% include wp.html link="Indonesia" %}&mdash;when it achieved independence from the Netherlands in 1949 it agreed to become a federation (at the request of the Netherlands), but the Indonesians feared this was an attempt to weaken the nation, make it more susceptible to being retaken by the Dutch, as part of a divide and conquer strategy. So a year later it became a unitary state, but with devolved powers. 
* {% include wp.html link="South Africa" %}
* {% include wp.html link="Spain" %}

In Spain's case while these devolved powers can theoretically be unilaterally revoked, the process is unclear and likely quite challenging, so hence it is probably as close to a federation as a devolved state can get.
