{% include h2.html text="Unitary state" %}
The main alternative type of country is referred to as a {% include wp.html link="unitary state" f="b" %}, where there is a national government that has ultimate authority in the land. Unitary states that voluntarily delegate some self-governance to subnational (e.g. provincial) governments are referred to as {% include wp.html art="Devolution" link="devolved states" f="b" puncr="," %} with a classic example being the United Kingdom, and its self-governing regions of Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. This self-governance the national government has delegated away to subnational governments can be unilaterally revoked, or lessened (e.g. laws can be overruled).
