Organizational structure

<!-- Federation definition -->
{% include h2.html text="Federation" %} 
Some countries comprise a union of many smaller partially self-governing regions under a central federal government; such countries are referred to as {% include wp.html art="Federation" link="federal states" f="b" %} (**federations**). These partially self-governing regions may be called, among other things, states, cantons or provinces. 

Federations differ in their level of: 

1. {% include wp.html link="Centralization" art="Centralized_government" %} of powers&mdash;whether most power is held by the federal government or by the subnational governments. This more exists as a spectrum, with Canada and the former USSR being more centralized than Australia or the US. 

2. {% include wp.html link="Symmetry" art="Symmetric_federalism" %} in authority&mdash;whether all subnational entities are treated equally, such as in terms of their autonomy. The Russian Federation is an example of an asymmetric federation, wherein some federal subjects have greater autonomy and powers than others. Australia and the US are examples of symmetric federations. 

3. Duality, whether the subnational and federal governments work in concert ({% include wp.html link="cooperative" art="Cooperative_federalism" %}) or fairly independently ({% include wp.html link="dual" art="Dual_federalism" %}), with clearly defined boundaries on their respective powers. Australia is an example of a dual federation, whereas the US is an example of a cooperative federation. 

<!-- Unitary state definition -->
{% include h2.html text="Unitary state" %}
The main alternative type of country is referred to as a {% include wp.html link="unitary state" f="b" %}, where there is a national government that has ultimate authority in the land. Unitary states that voluntarily delegate some self-governance to subnational (e.g. provincial) governments are referred to as {% include wp.html art="Devolution" link="devolved states" f="b" puncr="," %} with a classic example being the {% include wp.html link="United Kingdom" puncr="," %} and its self-governing regions of {% include wp.html link="Wales" puncr="," %} {% include wp.html link="Northern Ireland" %} and {% include wp.html link="Scotland" puncr="." %} This self-governance the national government has delegated away to subnational governments can be unilaterally revoked, or lessened (e.g. laws can be overruled). Other notable examples of devolved states include:

* {% include wp.html link="France" %}
* {% include wp.html link="Indonesia" %}&mdash;when it achieved independence from the Netherlands in 1949 it agreed to become a federation (at the request of the Netherlands), but the Indonesians feared this was an attempt to weaken the nation, make it more susceptible to being retaken by the Dutch, as part of a divide and conquer strategy. So a year later it became a unitary state, but with devolved powers. 
* {% include wp.html link="South Africa" %}
* {% include wp.html link="Spain" %}

In Spain's case while these devolved powers can theoretically be unilaterally revoked, the process is unclear and likely quite challenging, so hence it is probably as close to a federation as a devolved state can get. 

<!-- Confederation -->
{% include h2.html text="Confederation vs. federation" %}
{% include wp.html link="Confederation" f="b" %} are another organizational structure arrangement wherein sovereign nations voluntarily, usually by means of a treaty, agree to join together for the purpose of achieving common goals (e.g. defence against a common enemy) or for mutual benefit (e.g. for freer trade). The distinction made between a confederation and a federation has evolved over time. Once upon a time the two terms were used interchangeably, but nowadays confederations are usually taken to mean:

* A fully voluntary union between sovereign states; by voluntary, I mean they are fully able to {% include wt.html link="secede" %} from the union, should they choose.
* The glue that joins the member states together, the confederal government, is usually quite weak and easily dissolved. 
* The states are given a great degree of autonomy, and only voluntarily give up some powers to the confederal government. 
* The confederal government is answerable and subordinate to those of the member states.

While in federations the initial choice to form a union is usually voluntary, but once the union is formed usually the member states have minimal ability to secede. If they can secede the procedure is often complicated and requires federal cooperation. In federations, the federal government is usually significantly stronger than a confederal government, with more powers that cannot be unilaterally lessened by the state governments. The federal government is often quite difficult (but not impossible, cf. the USSR) to dissolve. In federations, states usually have no real sovereignty and are generally treated as subordinate (e.g. federal laws usually prevail over state laws, if there are any inconsistencies).
