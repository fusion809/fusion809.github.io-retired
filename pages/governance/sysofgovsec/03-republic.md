{% include h2.html text="Republics" %}

Republics come in several different flavours (and yes, some republics have multiple different applicable adjectives) including:

<!-- Islamic -->
* {% include wp.html art="Islamic republic" link="Islamic" f="b" %}&mdash;republics ruled by Islamic laws. There are, at the time of writing, four Islamic republics in the world:

    - {% include wp.html link="Afghanistan" %}&mdash;follows a presidential system.
    - {% include wp.html link="Iran" %}&mdash;unique governance system that most closely resembles a presidential system.
    - {% include wp.html link="Mauritania" %}&mdash;otherwise government as a semi-presidential republic.
    - {% include wp.html link="Pakistan" %}&mdash;otherwise it is governed in a similar way to India, with a parliament vested with executive and legislative power and a separate judiciary.

<!-- Presidential -->
* {% include wp.html f="b" art="Presidential_system" link="Presidential" %}&mdash;systems in which there is a popularly elected president that is both head of state and head of government, and there is a separate, largely independent legislature that is overseen by other elected officials (e.g. senators and congresspersons). The legislature has fairly minimal ability to affect the executive branch and vice versa, except via use of powers that are designed to only be used in exceptional circumstances (e.g. the legislature can often impeach the president, but it is challenging, likewise the president has the ability to veto any legislation that is pending approval). High ranking members of the judiciary are often appointed by the president, with the consent of the senate. The US is the prototypical presidential republic.

    They tend to be relatively unstable, rank less well on measures of democracy (e.g. look at Turkey and Zimbabwe) and often end in a coup d'Ã©tat, because of the difficulty in removing an unruly president and the difficulty in passing legislation when the president's political views differ from those of the legislature.

<!-- Semi-presidential -->
* {% include wp.html f="b" art="Semi-presidential system" link="Semi-presidential" %}&mdash;systems where executive power is vested in both a popularly elected president and a cabinet (which includes its leader, the prime minister/premier/chancellor, whom I will simply refer to as PM). The president appoints members of the cabinet (ministers), on the advice of the PM (who the president also appoints), but they are responsible to the legislature. The PM is usually a member of the legislature, but is not necessarily. 

    Whether the president can dismiss the PM or not depends greatly on the specific subtype of semi-presidential system in question&mdash;under the **premier-presidential** system they cannot, while under **president-parliamentary** systems they can. Under this system the president is mostly concerned with foreign policy and defence, while the PM deals largely with domestic policy. France is the prototypical semi-presidential (specifically premier-presidential) republic, while Russia and the Weimar Republic that preceded Nazi Germany are noted examples of president-parliamentary systems. 

    They seem to be particularly easy to abuse and turn into a dictatorship as they are present in countries that rank consistently near the bottom on measures of democracy (e.g. DRC, Russia), and was present in the {% include wp.html link="Weimar Republic" puncr="," %} which preceded {% include wp.html link="Nazi Germany" puncr="." %}

<!-- Parliamentary -->
* {% include wp.html art="Parliamentary_republic" link="Parliamentary" f="b" %}&mdash;this is a common type of republic in Europe, wherein the legislative and executive branches are fused, as members of the executive branch are usually also members of legislature and are responsible to the legislature (which is called "parliament"). Many former PCMs that are now republics are parliamentary republics, which is the case for:

    - {% include wp.html link="Botswana" %}
    - {% include wp.html link="India" %}
    - {% include wp.html link="Fiji" %}
    - {% include wp.html link="Iceland" %}
    - {% include wp.html link="Ireland" %}
    - {% include wp.html link="Myanmar" %}
    - {% include wp.html link="South Africa" %}

    Usually the executive head of government is called the prime minister and there is a largely ceremonial president (that basically serves the same roles as the Governor/Governor-General does in a PCM), but there are some such countries where the president is the head of government and there is no prime minister (e.g. Botswana, South Africa). When the president is ceremonial usually they are popularly elected (either directly, or by an electoral college), while if they are executive they are usually appointed by, and responsible to, the parliament.

<!-- Directorial -->
* {% include wp.html f="b" art="Directorial system" link="Directorial" %}&mdash;these are rare systems, of which there is only one, maybe two, modern examples ({% include wp.html link="Switzerland" %} for certain, {% include wp.html link="San Marino" %} is a disputed example), they are somewhat similar to parliamentary systems with an executive presidency in that their executive leadership is named by the parliament. The difference is that more than one person (2 for San Marino, 7 for Switzerland) jointly serves as both head of state and head of government and has equal authority. They jointly make decisions and serve for fixed terms and cannot be removed prematurely by the parliament. Usually these leaders are of different parties as well. 

<!-- One-party -->
* {% include wp.html f="b" art="One-party system" link="One-party" %}&mdash;these are usually Marxist-Leninist states, like what was present in the {% include wp.html link="USSR" art="Soviet_Union" puncr="," %} and is now in place in {% include wp.html link="China" puncr="," %} {% include wp.html link="Vietnam" %} and {% include wp.html link="Laos" puncr="." %} They are authoritarian states wherein all, or almost all, authority is vested in a single political party, which is the only party that legally can be in charge. These parties usually hold to a single ideology and if they are {% include wp.html link="Marxist-Leninist" %} their stated goal is to one day achieve Marxist communism. They do this by imposing state capitalism, wherein most businesses are state-owned and operated for the state's profit so that they can develop their capitalist economy and create a state of abundance. Under Marxist thought communism can only be achieved in a state of abundance and this is why they implement state capitalism despite claiming to be socialist. China's economy is presently the second fastest growing in the world after India and has not experienced negative growth (i.e. a recession) since the 1970s and their GDP (PPP) is presently the highest in the world.

<!-- Socialist -->
* {% include wp.html f="b" art="Socialist_state" link="Socialist" %}&mdash;these are nations that are officially, that is constitutionally, dedicated to the establishment of {% include wp.html link="socialism" puncr="." %} Many such countries are also one-party states, but not all are. Examples of at least {% include wt.html link="nominally" art="nominal" %} democratic states that are also socialist by this definition include, but are not limited to: {% include wp.html link="Bangladesh" puncr="," %} {% include wp.html link="Guyana" puncr="," %} {% include wp.html link="India" %} and {% include wp.html link="Tanzania" puncr="." %}
