{% include h2.html text="Monarchies" %}

Under monarchy there are three main basic types:

* {% include wp.html art="Absolute_monarchy" link="Absolute" f="b" %} (**AM**)&mdash;where the monarch has absolute power over every aspect of government. These were once more commonplace than they are now, as if the monarch abuses this power enough (which usually eventually happens) they are often removed forcibly by a {% include wp.html link="coup d'Ã©tat" puncr="" %} and the system of government is often changed, either to a republic or a more limited monarchy. Saudi Arabia and Oman are two notable examples of absolute monarchies that still exist today.

* {% include wp.html f="b" art="Constitutional_monarchy" link="Parliamentary constitutional" %} (**PCM**)&mdash;where the monarch has mostly ceremonial powers and most of the country's governance is done via democratic means. Notable examples of this include {% include wp.html link="Commonwealth realms" art="Commonwealth_realm" %}, several other European monarchies (e.g. the {% include wp.html link="Netherlands" %} and {% include wp.html link="Norway" puncr=")," %} {% include wp.html link="Japan" %} and {% include wp.html link="Malaysia" puncr="." %}

* **Dual system constitutional** (**DSCM**)&mdash;where the monarch retains significant power, but there is still a parliament (often fairly weak) and constitutional limits on the monarch's power. The most notable example of this is {% include wp.html link="Morocco" puncr="." %}

    If one goes purely by what the constitution of Commonwealth realms says one would also have to consider Commonwealth realms as DSCMs, as they vest complete executive power in the monarch or their representative, along with some legislative powers (e.g. the power to give assent or not to legislation). Despite this, theoretical power, the monarch/their representative almost always acts in accordance with the advice of elected officials, so in practice Commonwealth realms function more as PCMs.

{% include wp.html link="Thailand" %} is a PCM that has had its constitutional provisions for governance suspended and is presently under {% include wp.html link="military dictatorship" puncr="." %}
