{% include h2.html text="Legislative branch" %}
A proposed law is called a {% include wp.html link="bill" dis="law" f="b" %} until it is passed by the legislature and written into law. Legislatures may comprise a single chamber wherein members vote on a bill as a single unit, or they may comprise multiple chambers (sometimes referred to as *houses*) that debate and vote separately and have different roles. Legislatures with a single chamber are usually referred to as {% include wp.html art="Unicameralism" link="unicameral" f="b" puncr="," %} while those with two chambers are called {% include wp.html art="Bicameralism" link="bicameral" f="b" puncr="." %} Historically, legislatures with more chambers have existed (e.g. a {% include wp.html art="Tricameralism" link="three-chamber legislature" f="b" %} existed for a time during late apartheid {% include wp.html puncr=")," link="South Africa" %} but presently there are none in existence.

In bicameral legislatures one chamber is often called the {% include wp.html f="b" link="lower house" %} and the other, the {% include wp.html f="b" link="upper house" puncr="." %} Legislatures modelled after that of the UK usually have a far stronger lower house than upper house, while in others both have approximately equal power (e.g. the {% include wp.html link="Australian Senate" puncr=")" %} and in others the upper house has some unique powers the lower house does not have (e.g. the {% include wp.html link="United States Senate" puncr=")." %} Lower houses are nearly always directly popularly elected, while the upper house is often not. 

In unicameral legislatures the sole chamber is almost always directly popularly elected by the people.
