<h2 id="#branches" style="background-color: white; border: none;">Branches of government</h2>
There are **three branches**, or powers of government: the {% include wp.html art="Legislature" link="legislative" f="b" %} branch (legislature), that creates, modifies and repeals laws; the {% include wp.html art="Judiciary" link="judicial" f="b" %} branch (judiciary/judicature), that interprets and applies the law; and, the {% include wp.html art="Executive_(government)" link="executive" f="b" %} branch that executes and enforces the law. In the presidential system of the {% include wp.html art="United_States" link="US" %} there is a fairly clean separation of these three branches, in an attempt to reduce the potential for a dictatorship to take hold.
