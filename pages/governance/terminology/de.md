{% include wp.html link="de facto" f="bi" %} literally means "in fact" and is generally meant to mean not legally recognized to be so, but in reality is so. This is as opposed to {% include wp.html link="de jure" f="bi" %} which means "in law". For example, a country wherein the *de facto* language is English, such as Australia, is one wherein there is no law explicitly giving English official status as the language of the land, but given it is the dominant language and the language used in official government communication it may as well be the official language. In fact, countries wherein English is given *de jure* status like {% include wp.html link="India" %} and {% include wp.html link="South Africa" %} often have lower levels of English fluency than countries wherein it merely has a *de facto* official status.
