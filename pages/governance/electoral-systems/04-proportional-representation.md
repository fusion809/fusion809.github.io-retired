{% include h2.html text="Proportional representation" %}

Proportional representation (PR) systems are electoral systems that attempt to represent political parties proportionally to the share of the votes they received. So, say in a parliamentary election the split of the votes is as follows:

* Australian Greens (AG)&mdash;20%.
* Australian Labor Party (ALP)&mdash;30%.
* Katter's Australian Party (KAP)&mdash;10%.
* Liberal-National Coalition (LNC)&mdash;30%.
* Pauline Hanson's One Nation (PHON)&mdash;10%. 

Then, under a perfect PR system, in a legislative chamber of 150 members, AG would receive 30 seats (20% of 150), ALP would receive 45 seats (30% of 150), KAP would receive 15 seats (10% of 150), LNC would receive 45 seats and PHON would receive 15 seats. PR systems include:

* {% include wp.html art="Mixed-member_proportional_representation" link="Mixed-member PR" %} (MMPR), wherein some representatives are elected using plurality/majoritarian methods, usually from single-member electorates, but some are elected using party-list PR (PLPR) to proportion out the chamber to achieve PR. Every voter is given two votes: one for someone to represent their simple member constituency and a party vote. New Zealand uses MMPR, with FPTP employed to elect members from single-member electorates and PLPR to elect other members to proportion things out. 

* {% include wp.html link="Party-list proportional representation" %} (PLPR)&mdash;arguably the simplest version of PR, is one wherein voters vote for a party, or, as is allowed in open-list systems, an independent, to represent them. This is perhaps the single most popular electoral system worldwide and is used for lower house elections in almost every Latin American nation.

* {% include wp.html link="Single transferable vote" %} (STV)&mdash;essentially IRV adjusted for the purpose of electing multiple members per electorate. 

    In it voters assign preferences to each candidate. Then votes are totalled based on first preferences, then a quota every candidate will need in order to get elected is calculated. Candidates that reach this quota on first preferences are elected, their surplus votes (i.e. the votes that are above the quota they need in order to get elected) may be (depending on the precise system) transferred, based on next preferences. If any additional candidates reach quota they are elected, any surplus is reallocated based on next preferences. Then, whichever candidate has the lowest total votes is eliminated and their votes are reallocated based on next preferences. If any new candidates have reached quota they are elected, and this process continues on until all the number of candidates left is equal to the number of seats left, at which point the remaining candidates are just elected.

    Depending on how many members are elected per electorate and how many electorates there are, STV can be described as semi-proportional, instead of fully proportional, as the fewer members there are per electorate the less proportional and more IRV-like STV becomes.
