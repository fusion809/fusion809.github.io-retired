{% include h2.html text="Semi-proportional representation" %}

These systems, while more proportionally representative than majoritarian and plurality systems, they are less proportional than truly proportional systems like MMPR, PLPR and STV. SPR systems include:

* {% include wp.html link="Limited voting" puncr="," %} essentially a generalized version of SNTV. In it voters are given fewer votes than there are positions available&mdash;whichever candidates receive the most votes absolutely get elected. 
* Parallel voting, where a majority/plurality electoral system is used to elect some members, while proportional representation is used to elect other members. 
* {% include wp.html link="Single non-transferable vote (SNTV)" art="Single_non-transferable_vote" puncr="," %} which is used for multi-member electorates where each voter gets a single vote and whichever candidates receive the most votes are elected. 

STV can also be described as semi-proportional when the number of members per district is low relative to the total number of candidates to be elected.
