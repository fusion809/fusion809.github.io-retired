{% include h2.html text="Plurality voting" %}

These systems are in which a single winner is chosen from a variety (or plurality) of candidates by a simple, relative majority. The simplest example is {% include wp.html link="first-past-the-post" puncr="," %} in which a single representative is chosen from a single-member electorate. Say, for example, we have five candidates&mdash;candidate A, B, C, D and E&mdash;they receive 19.9%, 20%, 20.1%, 19.8% and 20.2%, respectively. Then candidate E would win, even though they only beat candidate C by a 0.1% margin and the poorest performing candidate, candidate D, by a just 0.4% margin.
