At the time of writing (acronym: ATTOW; date of writing: 12 July 2018) this paragraph I have a total of eighty-seven packages in my [openSUSE Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org) (OBS) [home project](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:fusion809). Although some are presently not building and six of them ([gvim-gtk2](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:fusio809/gvim-gtk2), [vim](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:fusio809/vim), [vim-debian](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:fusio809/vim-debian), [vim-debian-gtk3](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:fusio809/vim-debian-gtk3), [vim-redhat](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:fusio809/vim-redhat), [vim-suse](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:fusio809/vim-suse)) provide bleeding-edge Vim, just for different platforms. The platform with the most successful builds (40 ATTOW) is openSUSE Tumbleweed (OT), my primary operating system for the past few months. 

ATTOW here is the categorical breakdown of my packages:

Games:

- Application: 0 A.D. Packages: 0ad, 0ad-data.
- Application: OpenRA (core + default mods). Packages: openra, openra-bleed.
- Application: OpenRA Unplugged RA.
