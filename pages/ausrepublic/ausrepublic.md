Ever since the continent of Australia was colonized by the British in the late 18th century, Australia&mdash;including its former colonies, the Commonwealth of Australia and the states&mdash;have been under the crown of a foreign monarch. Many people falsely claim that in 1901, Australia gained its independence from the British Empire, but we were still very much part of the Empire until the Second World War, when the [*Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942*](https://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item-did-25.html) was enacted by the Curtin Government. Even after this date and until the passing of the [*Australia Acts 1986*](https://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item-did-32.html), the parliaments of the states were still subject to the lawmaking power of the United Kingdom (UK) Parliament, the monarch still acted on the advice of the UK Government in appointing state governors, and court decisions made with respect to state matters were still subject to appeal by the {% include wp.html link="Judicial Committee of the UK Privy Council" art="Judicial_Committee_of_the_Privy_Council" puncr=".<sup>1</sup>" %}

Since then, while not subject to the lawmaking power of the UK Parliament, nor the advisory power of the UK Government in the appointing of our viceroys, nor to appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (except through [section 74 of the Constitution](http://www6.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s74.html), which allows the High Court to grant appeals to the Privy Council on *inter se* matters, although the High Court has indicated their intention to never grant that), we have still been under their monarch, and not truly independent as a result. 

Equally important is the fact that our current system is inconsistent with the values we, as a nation, claim to cherish and value, such as:
* democracy, given our head of state and their representatives are unelected;
* a {% include wt.html link="fair go" art="fair go" language="Noun" puncr="," %} given the highest position of constitutional honour&mdash;that of head of state&mdash;is not one that an Australian can ever occupy, not even through hard work and sacrifice; and
* egalitarianism, as it creates two classes of people: those that are entitled, by birthright, to occupy a position of privilege and honour; and those that are not.

Our current system is also deeply flawed in another way, which was most spectacularly illustrated during the constitutional crisis of 1975, when the Governor-General dismissed the Prime Minister, without warning, for fear that if he did warn him or otherwise discuss his concerns with him, the Prime Minister would have him sacked. Giving two people the power to both appoint and sack one another is a recipe for disaster, especially when those people have jobs where it is sometimes necessarily to speak frankly with one another in order to achieve the best possible outcome. 

Monarchist arguments debunked
================================

**Argument 1**: we already have an Australian head of state, the Governor-General, so why do we need a republic?

**Response 1**: the Constitution makes it clear that the monarch is at the highest position in the country, with everything below them in the state hierarchy, hence making them the head of state. The Governor-General is merely their representative. 

In the few Commonwealth realms who's Constitution explicitly says who the head of state is, the monarch is named as the head of state, not the governor-general.

**Argument 2**: if we become a republic we will inevitably have a politician as head of state, which will threaten the apolitical nature of the position. 

**Response 2**: 11 out of the 27 governors-general we have had since Federation have been politicians, and those governors-general have served in a completely apolitical and uncontroversial way. Our most controversial governors-general have all been non-politicians, such as John Kerr (lawyer, judge), Peter Hollingworth (Anglican bishop) and Quentin Bryce (academic).

If the Governor-General has been a politician before, yet still respected the apolitical nature of the office, why cannot we expect a republican head of state to do the same? Our current arrangements make it far more easy for a politician to become Governor-General than it would be for a politician to become head of state in an Australian republic. The two most popular appointment methods for an Australian republican head of state are parliamentary appointment and direct election, both of which involve more consensus-building in the appointment process than the current appointment procedure for the Governor-General, hence are less likely to lead to an unsuitable person holding the position. In case you are unaware, since the Balfour Declaration of 1926, the Governor-General has been appointed by the monarch on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. The monarch has never, since the Balfour Declaration of 1926, appointed someone against prime ministerial advice. As the Governor-General has the power to sack the Prime Minister, it makes sense that governors-general have usually been people that the Prime Minister that had them appointed have known personally. 

Many parliamentary republics exist out there that have an apolitical head of state, and experience in those jurisdictions have generally shown that politicians are just as capable of respecting the apolitical nature of the office as non-politicians. For example, Ireland's current President, Michael D. Higgins, is a politician and yet he has served as a perfectly impartial head of state for Ireland. This is also despite the fact that in Ireland the President is directly elected by the people.

**Argument 3**: if we become a republic, we will inevitably become a dictatorship like the Weimar Republic did.

**Response 3**: the identity of our head of state is irrelevant as to whether we become a dictatorship. Some of the most stable and true democracies in the world are republics, such as Switzerland, likewise some countries have become dictatorships while being constitutional monarchies, such as Fiji during their 1987 coups (the later of which lead to them establishing a republic), Fascist Italy, the Empire of Japan during World War II and Thailand in 2014. Under the monarchy, we have been slipping on our rankings of democratic functioning and transparency for the past decade or so, and authoritarian and rights-infringing laws have been passed despite it (e.g. anti-encryption laws, laws that penalize whistleblowers and journalists alike). 

If you look at Ireland post-republic and compare it to Ireland pre-republic you will likely find that post-republic Ireland is markedly more prosperous and stable than its pre-republic counterpart. It actually ranks higher on measures of democracy than Australia, like the Democracy Index. It is exactly the type of republic most Australians want too, a Westminster-style republic with a directly elected head of state.
