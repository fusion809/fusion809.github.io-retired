The {% include wp.html link="Commonwealth of Australia" art="Australia" f="b" %} has a rather unique political system that is not found in any other country. Most of its elements are taken from three other federations that were present at the time of its founding and still exist today&mdash;{% include wp.html link="Canada" puncr="," %} {% include wp.html link="Switzerland" %} and the {% include wp.html link="United States" %} (US). Its elements taken from Canada are mostly those borrowed from the former British Empire; they are not taken directly from the {% include wp.html link="British Empire" %} because it had no written constitution, while Canada has. Due to its unique blend of {% include wp.html link="Westminster" art="Westminster_system" %} and American (or Washington) elements it is often referred to as the Washminster (a {% include wt.html link="portmanteau" art="portmanteau_word" word-class="Noun" %} of Washington and Westminster) system or mutation. It was the first country in the world to be founded with the direct consent of the people as a whole, that was obtained by {% include wp.html link="referendum" puncr="," %} instead of merely the consent of the ruling elite. 

**Westminster characteristics** incorporated in the Australian system and in the systems of most Australian states include:<sup><a href="#f1">1</a></sup>

1. A {% include wp.html link="head of state" f=b %} that either holds {% include wt.html link="de jure" f="i" word-class="Adjective" %} supreme executive power or has a representative that holds such power and the power to promulgate (or not) laws, but that by convention only acts on the advice of the {% include wp.html link="cabinet" art="cabinet_(government)" %} {% include wp.html link="ministers" puncr="," art="Minister_(government)" %} except in exceptional circumstances when they utilize their {% include wp.html link="reserve powers" puncr="." %} They are meant to act as an independent, non-partisan referee that can only use their reserve powers when necessary in order to defend the constitution.
2. A separate {% include wt.html link="de facto" f="i" word-class="Adjective" %} {% include wp.html link="head of government" %} (HoG) that by convention is appointed by the head of state or their representative, and is the "first among equals" with the other cabinet ministers. The HoG is, by convention, the parliamentary leader of the party that occupies the most seats in the lower house of the parliament, or is the leader of the largest party within the coalition that occupies more seats than the other parties or coalitions in the lower house of the parliament. This HoG, by convention, also occupies a seat in this lower house.
3. Cabinet ministers that are elected parliamentary members of the party or coalition who's members occupy a majority of seats in the lower house of the parliament. In the case of a hung parliament, where no party or coalition occupies a majority of seats, whichever party or coalition occupies more seats than the rest normally gets to form government.
4. A treasurer that occupies a seat in the lower house.
5. An attorney-general that is a member of the cabinet and an attorney by trade. 
6. A lower house comprised solely of members elected from single member electorates, such as using {% include wp.html link="first-past-the-post" %} (FPTP; the chief method used historically) or {% include wp.html link="instant-runoff voting" %} (IRV). This is where New Zealand's system, for example, breaks with tradition, as does Tasmania, as they use proportional representation for their lower house.
7. A lower house that can dismiss the government with a motion of no confidence. This is unlikely to pass if the majority of members of this lower house belong to the governing party or coalition. 
8. A constitutional or by convention requirement that the governing party or coalition must secure supply by passing the required appropriation bills through the parliament; failing this, they nay be dismissed by the head of state or their representative. This is what happened in Australia during the {% include wp.html link="1975 constitutional crisis" puncr="," %} when the Governor-General dismissed the Prime Minister.
9. An official {% include wp.html link="parliamentary opposition" art="Opposition_(parliamentary)" %} that is either the party or coalition that has the most seats in the lower house of the parliament of any party or coalition that is not in government. This is assuming the system is multi-party, which most Westminster systems are, but some of the smaller countries with such a system are non-partisan, so do not meet this requirement. 
10. {% include wp.html link="Parliamentary privilege" %}&mdash;which allows for free and open speech in the parliament without any potential for legal repercussions. 
11. Cabinet decisions are either reached by consensus or by voting; it is not a simple matter of what the HoG wants is what they get (unlike in the US).
12. Once the cabinet reaches a decision all ministers are expected to adhere to it and respect it. 
13. Ministers are also expected not to publicly criticize the actions of other members of the cabinet and the exercise of their powers over their own respective portfolio. There was at least once situation where a minister broke this rule in Australia (namely, [Barnaby Joyce did so in 2015](https://theconversation.com/joyce-breaks-cabinet-rules-but-his-fate-is-pms-call-44557)).
14. {% include wp.html link="Hansard" %}&mdash;a transcript of parliamentary meetings.
15. Strong {% include wp.html link="party discipline" %}; members of a given party nearly always vote the same way. The ALP even has formal rules against crossing party lines. 

While the **American aspects of our system** include:

1. An elected upper house, or {% include wp.html link="Senate" art="Australian_Senate" puncr="," %} that represents each of the original states equally. At the time of federation some but not all US Senators were directly popular elected, with the remaining senators elected by state legislatures. By contrast, the British and Canadian systems have appointed, and not elected upper houses. 
2. An upper house with almost equal legislative powers to the lower house, with the main exception being that they cannot introduce or amend {% include wp.html link="money bills" art="Money_bill" %}. To be fair, at the time of federation, this was also a characteristic of the British system. 
3. The Constitution specifies only the powers that belong to the federal government and that all other powers belong to the states. This is as opposed to the Canadian system, for example, wherein the Constitution only specifies powers that belong to the states, with all other powers vested in the federal government. 
4. The names of our legislature's lower and upper houses&mdash;the House of Representatives and the Senate, respectively.

The **principle Swiss feature** present in the Australian system is that any amendments to the Constitution must be made with the direct consent of the people, that is to be obtained by referendum. 

Unlike Canada and the US there are no restrictions placed on the age of members of the legislative and executive branches, except that they are old enough to vote and be considered an adult in the eyes of the law. Also, unlike the US, there are no requirements regarding how their citizenship was obtained; according to the US Constitution, the President has to have been born in the US or otherwise eligible for citizenship upon birth, like having a parent with US citizenship.
