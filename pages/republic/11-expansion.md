Expansion of the nation
========================

Australia should expand to include extra states in the Pacific Ocean, along with the island of New Guinea and neighbouring, smaller islands that are on the Australian continental shelf, along with those belonging to PNG (e.g. New Britain). These expansions should be voluntary, without the use of military might to force our neighbours to join. All inducements to join should be peaceful. 

All new states should be mandated to teach English in their schools, specifically Australian English, but local English variants should be allowed to be taught as well. The schools will naturally be allowed to teach any additional local languages as well, but Australian English should be taught simply to allow for easier communication in Canberra, and so that the citizens can better understand federal MPs and senators. Adult education schools will be opened in these states that teach English and are open every day of the week. 

I propose, to accommodate different cultures and attitudes and reduce what the new federal subjects lose by gaining us, to create a new type of federal subject (with the existing ones being non-autonomous territories, autonomous territories and states) called 'republics', that have a higher degree of autonomy to the states and territories. Additional states that I propose should join us include (only if my reforms raise our GDP per capita markedly, to the point that we can have some financial leeway):

* {% include wp.html link="Bougainville Island" %} (if it becomes an independent state)&mdash;while their GDP per capita might be higher than PNG's it is markedly lower than that of Australia, so it has a lot to gain by joining us as a federal subject. 
* {% include wp.html link="Federated States of Micronesia" %}&mdash;much the same benefits that Bougainville Island can gain from joining us. 
* {% include wp.html link="Fiji" %}&mdash;our greater degree of stability, lower levels of corruption, stronger democracy, social benefits and a stronger economy should entice them to join. I am aware they refused to join in federation, but technologic advancements should eliminate some of the reasons they refused (e.g. the long travel times between the mainland and Fiji).
* {% include wp.html link="Marshall Islands" %}&mdash;much the same benefits that Bougainville Island can gain from joining us. 
* {% include wp.html link="Nauru" %}&mdash;much the same benefits that Bougainville Island can gain from joining us. 
* {% include wp.html link="New Caledonia" %}&mdash;and yes, I do know it is part of France. But, it has a lower GDP per capita than us, and if we grant it a high level of autonomy it makes sense for them join us. 
* {% include wp.html link="New Zealand" %}&mdash;they refused to join us at the time of federation, but if we give them enticements to join, like a high degree of autonomy, a lower taxation rate than they presently have, along with a stronger economy, that has been recession-free for decades. If I have implemented several reforms to strengthen the economy and improve on social security, housing, education and healthcare that should also entice them. We would gain additional land, including some arable land, some beautiful tourism destinations and additional Antarctic territory. 
* {% include wp.html link="Niue" %}&mdash;their GDP per capita (PPP) is about half that of Fiji. 
* {% include wp.html link="Samoa" %}&mdash;their GDP per capita is even lower than Fiji, and they have even more to gain by joining us. 
* {% include wp.html link="Solomon Islands" %}&mdash;their GDP per capita is even lower than Fiji, and they have even more to gain by joining us.
* {% include wp.html link="Tokelau" %}&mdash;their GDP per capita is also lower than ours, but roughly on par with Fiji. 
* {% include wp.html link="Tonga" %}&mdash;their GDP per capita is also lower than ours, but roughly on par with Fiji. 
* {% include wp.html link="Tuvalu" %}&mdash;their GDP per capita is also lower than ours, but roughly on par with Fiji. 
* {% include wp.html link="Vanuatu" %}&mdash;their GDP per capita is also far lower, as is their level of human development, so they have much to gain by joining us. 
* {% include wp.html link="Wallis and Futuna" %}&mdash;their GDP per capita is also far lower, as is their level of human development, so they have much to gain by joining us.
