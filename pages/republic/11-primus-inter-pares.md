Ministerial roles
==================

The power of the Prime Minister (PM) should be no greater than that of the other ministers. All Cabinet decisions should be reached by consensus, or if that cannot be reached, a vote. If an absolute majority (i.e. >50% of votes in favour of one option) cannot be reached in said votes instant-runoff voting should be used. The reason for this is that more power you give one person, the more likely they will be corrupted by it, as absolute power corrupts absolutely.
