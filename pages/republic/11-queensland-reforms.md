{% include wp.html link="Queensland" %} reforms
===================

Any amendment to [Queensland's Constitution](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/pdf/2002-06-06/act-2001-080) should require a referendum, not only those covered in [section 53 of the original Act](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/pdf/2002-06-06/act-2001-080#G3.1015016), as it is such a fundamental Act that it should be protected from unpopular, or poorly thought out amendments.
