{% include wp.html link="Queensland" %} reforms
===================

Any amendment to [Queensland's Constitution](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/pdf/2002-06-06/act-2001-080) should require a referendum, not only those covered in [section 53 of the original Act](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/pdf/2002-06-06/act-2001-080#G3.1015016), as it is such a fundamental Act that it should be protected from unpopular, or poorly thought out amendments.

Likewise, I would also like to see the {% include wp.html link="Legislative Council" art="Queensland_Legislative_Council" %} reinstated, except instead of consisting of appointed individuals it would consist of officials elected using {% include wp.html link="single-transferable vote" %} (STV) with the whole state treated as one massive electorate. Why only one electorate? To maximize the proportionality of STV&mdash;the fewer the people to be elected per electorate the less proportional STV gets. This upper house would have similar powers to the Australian Senate relative to its respective lower house&mdash;able to introduce, amend or reject any legislation it wants that the Parliament has the ability to, with the exception being its inability to introduce or amend any money-related legislation.

The [*Human Rights Act 2019*](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/whole/html/asmade/act-2019-005) should be replaced with a more comprehensive and powerful (with better enforcement provisions) act, and it should be added to the Constitution, to ensure it can never be arbitrarily amended or even repealed altogether by any oppressive and tyrannical future government.
