National electoral reform
=================

The Constitution should be amended to allow electorates for the {% include wp.html art="Australian_House_of_Representatives" link="<b>House of Representatives</b>" %} (**HoR**) to cross state borders, and to remove the requirement that all original states have at least 5 MPs. The Constitution should also be amended to remove the prohibition on electorates crossing state borders and mandate that the '{% include wp.html link="one vote, one value" %}' principle be upheld for the HoR, with at most 5% variation in the number of voters each MP represents. This is to fix the malapportionment in the HoR&mdash;presently, the five Tasmanian electorates each have approximately 50,000 fewer voters than the {% include wp.html link="Division of Cowper" %} in New South Wales (NSW), and that is largely because the Constitution mandates that each original state have at least 5 MPs and that electorates cannot cross state borders.

It would also be ideal to increase the number of members of the HoR to 324. In the {% include wp.html link="first federal election" art="1901_Australian_federal_election" puncr="," %} there were approximately 6,746 voters per MP, while in the {% include wp.html link="2019 election" art="2019_Australian_federal_election" %} there were approximately 94,393 voters per MP. Steadily, over time the number of voters per MP has been trending upward; it is about time we do something about it. With more MPs proper apportionment will likely be easier.
