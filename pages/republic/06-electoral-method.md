Electoral system
=================

If my electorate meetings proposed change is not made, then the {% include wp.html art="Australian_House_of_Representatives" link="House of Representatives" %} should be elected using {% include wp.html link="mixed-member proportional representation" f="b" %} (**MMPR**), with most candidates elected from single member constituencies using {% include wp.html link="instant-runoff voting" puncr="," %} but some being appointed based on the percentage of votes being cast nationwide in favour of them (if they are an independent) or their party (the amount depends on how many are necessary to achieve roughly proportional representation). If a party/independent does not receive enough votes for them to win a seat their votes will be passed on to second preferences, if that second preference does not get in either, then they will pass to the third preference and so forth. Likewise, if a party receives more votes than necessary to get them the number of seats they end up getting, their excess votes will be transferred to their next preference, if they get an excess the votes will transfer to the next preference and so forth. The {% include wp.html art="Party-list_proportional_representation" link="party list" %} component will be {% include wp.html art="Open_list" link="open" puncr="," %} with each independent listed as a different option on the list.
