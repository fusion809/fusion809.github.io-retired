Attorney-General reform
=======================
The AG, and Shadow AG, must have at least an <abbr title="Bachelor of Laws">L.L.B.</abbr> degree and not be disqualified from any bar association (although, they do not need to be a member of one) due to any misbehaviour. By convention the AG and Shadow AG are attorneys, but this is not a legal requirement.
