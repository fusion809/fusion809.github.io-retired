Head of state powers
====================

Powers of such a head of state:

* The ability to dissolve the Parliament (either fully or in part) and call a new election (which must be held within a month of this dissolution) in the event of:

    - The Government failing to meet its constitutional obligations, like securing supply.

    - The Government breaking its pre-election promises in a deliberate and wilful way. Not being able to fulfil their promises due to their bills not being approved by the Parliament is not valid grounds. If they do not even attempt to introduce the bills they promised within a reasonable time frame (although, if an emergency occurs, such as war, they'll have more time to), despite warnings from the head of state, or if they start doing things they promised they would not do (e.g. dismantling Medicare, educational services, _etc._), then that is valid grounds for the Parliament to be dissolved.

    - Evidence of mass corruption in the Parliament, or Government.

    In this event, the head of state will have the right to turn any pending appropriation bills that are desperately needed into temporary law, that can be reversed by the new Parliament, once it is formed and convened for the first time, if they so desire. If, and only if, an emergency occurs that requires urgent legislation, the head of state will also have the power to draft a bill, and if after the High Court (HC) has examined it for faults (as there is not a full Parliament to do so, after all) and ruled it valid, the ministers of state vote in favour of it, it can be written into temporary law. This law will be reviewed by the new Parliament on its first sitting; if they agree with the law and vote in favour of it, it will formally become an Act of Parliament, making it no longer temporary. 

* Dismiss the Government and install a caretaker Government, if any only if, there is strong evidence of mass corruption in the Government or the government wilfully and deliberately broke pre-election promises.

* They can dismiss ministers of state, including the Prime Minister (PM), along with MPs and senators, if they have been convicted of corruption or misbehaviour or if they have wilfully broken pre-election promises. If there is evidence of corruption or misconduct, but they have not been convicted yet, the head of state will be able to temporarily dismiss them, pending the completion of the investigation, from their ministerial positions, but not their seats in the Parliament. 

Each of these powers will require the approval of the Constitutional Council (either a split decision, in which case the head of state is the tie breaker, or a majority in favour), which will consist of six members elected by a three-quarter majority vote in both houses of Parliament, after first being nominated by a consensus reached by the Attorney-General; Shadow Attorney-General; an attorney representing the third largest party in the Parliament (presently the Greens), preferably an attorney that is also a member of the Parliament; and the head of state themselves. The head of state will be involved in the process so that if the person nominated by the others is someone that has a personal vendetta against them, they have the ability to say no to their nomination. 

Once the head of state is elected, they will have the option to dismiss any member of the council and have them replaced, but they can only do this within the first month of their tenure as head of state, to ensure that they do not do so simply to remove people that are stopping them from using their powers irresponsibly. 

***Note**: they will not give assent to legislation, or have the ability to appoint any officials, or be commander-in-chief of the armed forces, or have any additional executive powers. These powers will be firmly vested in the ministers of state and the Parliament. Presently, under the monarchy the Governor-General (GG), by convention, almost always follows the advice of ministers of state when the GG exercises their executive powers, but there is no guarantee a future head of state will follow this convention if we transfer this power and convention to them, so it is prudent to limit what power they do have.*
