Presidential powers
====================

Powers of such a President:

* The ability to dissolve the Parliament (either fully or in part) and call a new election (which must be held within a month of this dissolution) in the event of:

    - The Government failing to meet its constitutional obligations, like securing supply.

    - The Government breaking many of its pre-election promises. Not being able to fulfil their promises due to their bills not being approved by the Parliament is not valid grounds. If they do not even attempt to introduce the bills they promised, or if they start doing things they promised they would not do (e.g. dismantling Medicare, educational services, _etc._), then that is valid grounds for the Parliament to be dissolved.

    - Evidence of mass corruption in the Parliament, or Government.

    In this event, the President will have the right to turn any pending appropriation bills that are desperately needed into temporary law, that can be reversed by the new Parliament, once it is formed and convened for the first time, if they so desire. If, and only if, an emergency occurs that requires urgent legislation, the President will also have the power to draft a bill, and if after the High Court (HC) has examined it for faults (as there is not a full Parliament to do so, after all) and ruled it valid, the ministers of state vote in favour of it, it can be written into temporary law. This law will be reviewed by the new Parliament on its first sitting; if they agree with the law and vote in favour of it, it will formally become an Act of Parliament, making it no longer temporary. 

* Dismiss the Government and install a caretaker Government, if any only if, there is strong evidence of mass corruption in the Government.  

* The power to defend the Constitution, via any means necessary. If they intend to do so via an action without precedence, they need to get the HC's approval on the legality of their action and whether the HC believes their action is appropriate. If the HC believes their proposal is illegal or inappropriate, then the HC may offer their own alternative solution.

* They can dismiss ministers of state, including the Prime Minister (PM), along with MPs and senators, if they have been convicted of corruption or misbehaviour or if they have wilfully broken pre-election promises. If there is evidence of corruption or misconduct, but they have not been convicted yet, the President will be able to temporarily dismiss them, pending the completion of the investigation, from their ministerial positions, but not their seats in the Parliament. 

* Temporarily vetoing legislation, pending a review of it by the HC, if they feel the legislation is legally invalid (e.g. if it is unconstitutional).

***Note**: they will not give assent to legislation, or have the ability to appoint any officials, or be commander-in-chief of the armed forces, or have any additional executive powers. These powers will be firmly vested in the ministers of state and the Parliament. Presently, under the monarchy the Governor-General (GG), by convention, almost always follows the advice of ministers of state when the GG exercises their executive powers, but there is no guarantee a future President will follow this convention if we transfer this power and convention to them, so it is prudent to limit what power they do have.*
