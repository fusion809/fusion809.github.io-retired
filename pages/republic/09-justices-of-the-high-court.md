Justices of the High Court
===========================

The AG and Shadow AG should be required to meet, along with their state and territory counterparts, to reach a consensus on whom to appoint to the HC as justices, when a new position opens up in the court. Why so many people have to be involved in this nomination process? Because the HC justices are meant to be impartial and well-qualified for the job (having at least an <abbr title="Master of Laws">L.L.M.</abbr> degree and not having been disqualified from any bar association for misconduct), so leaving it to just the AG to nominate candidates sounds imprudent, as they will obviously have their own political biases, but if  are forced to reach a consensus with their shadow, state and territory counterparts they will probably compromise on someone they can all agree are impartial and fit for the job. This is also important as once someone is appointed as a HC justice it is quite difficult to remove them before mandatory retirement. They should be required to debate and reach a consensus on at least five candidates per justice position available, which will then be presented to the Parliament to debate on, reach a consensus, or if that is not possible, elect them using single transferable vote (STV) or instant-runoff voting (IRV) (if only one justice needs to be selected).
