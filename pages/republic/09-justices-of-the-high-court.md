Justices of the High Court
===========================

The AG, Shadow AG and an attorney representing the third largest party in the Parliament should be required to meet, along with their state and territory counterparts, to reach a consensus on whom to appoint to the HC as justices, when a new position opens up in the court. Why do so many people have to be involved in this nomination process? Because the HC justices are meant to be impartial and well-qualified for the job (having at least an <abbr title="Master of Laws">L.L.M.</abbr> degree and not having been disqualified from any bar association for misconduct), so leaving it to just the AG to nominate candidates sounds imprudent, as they will obviously have their own political biases, but if they are forced to reach a consensus with their shadow, third largest party, state and territory counterparts they will probably compromise on candidates they can all agree are impartial and fit for the job. This is also important as once someone is appointed as a HC justice it is quite difficult to remove them before mandatory retirement. Then a three-quarter majority vote in both houses of Parliament should be required to appoint them.
