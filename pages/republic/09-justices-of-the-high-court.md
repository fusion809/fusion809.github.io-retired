Justices of the High Court
===========================
The AG and Shadow AG should be required to meet and reach a consensus on whom to appoint to the HC as justices, when a new position opens up in the court. Why do both the AG and Shadow AG have to be involved in this nomination process? Because the HC justices are meant to be impartial and well-qualified for the job (having at least an <abbr title="Master of Laws">L.L.M.</abbr> degree and not having been disqualified from any bar association for misconduct), so leaving it to just the AG to nominate candidates sounds imprudent, as they will obviously have their own political biases, but if the two are forced to reach a consensus they will probably compromise on someone they can both agree are impartial and fit for the job. They should be required to write a list of at least five candidates per justice position available, which will then be presented to the Parliament to debate on, reach a consensus, or if that is not possible, vote using single transferable voting or instant-runoff voting (if only one justice needs to be selected).
