Republic referendum
===========

The Commonwealth Parliament should decide the model, except with the broad details (e.g. the appointment method for the head of state) decided by what opinion polls have repeatedly said the people have wanted since the 1990s, and the public being free to ask questions and make suggestions either in person or online. No person should be mocked for their question or suggestion and there should be the option to submit questions or suggestions online anonymously.
