Removal mechanism
==================
There will be a few grounds and mechanisms for the removal of the head of state. If the head of state is serving as an embarrassment to the nation, the Parliament can impeach them by a three-quarter majority vote in both houses. It will automatically trigger a double dissolution, however, and new elections for both the Parliament and the head of state. If the head of state deliberately undermines the government, expresses political views, is found colluding with political parties, or otherwise fails to meet the requirements of the office, they can be removed by the Constitutional Council by a unanimous vote. If the vote is not unanimous, but members of the Council still seek to remove the head of state, they can bring a case against them in the High Court, which is also where the head of state can appeal a successful removal of them from office by the Council.
