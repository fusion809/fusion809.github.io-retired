Removal mechanism
==================
There will be a few grounds and mechanisms for the removal of the head of state. If the head of state deliberately undermines the government, embarrasses the nation, expresses political views, is found colluding with political parties, or otherwise fails to meet the requirements of the office, they can be removed by the High Court, after an action against them is brought by any parliamentarian or any attorney on their behalf. If the head of state is successfully removed by the Court, it will automatically trigger a double dissolution and new elections for both the head of state and the Parliament. This is partly to ensure that whomever brought the action against them is held accountable and to ensure that head of state and parliamentary elections do not get out of sync.
