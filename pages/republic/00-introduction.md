In 1999, Australians voted in a {% include wp.html art="1999_Australian_republic_referendum" link="referendum" %} on whether Australia should become a republic with a President elected by a two-thirds majority vote in Parliament. This proposal was defeated, but that was not because a majority of Australians did not want Australia to become a republic, rather it was because the voters were not in favour of the specific proposal they were offered. Some were in favour of a popularly elected President instead, and so am I.
