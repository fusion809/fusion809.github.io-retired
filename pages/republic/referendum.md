Republic referendum
===========
Best to give the responded multiple two-answer questions, instead of just one with several different answers. 

**Question 1**:

Do you want Australia to become a republic, with the head of state position, that is presently occupied by the British monarch, to be occupied instead by a President?

Regardless of their answer to this they will be allowed to answer the remaining questions too.

**Question 2**:

Do you want this President to be directly elected by the people of Australia?

If the answer is 'Yes', proceed to Q5, otherwise go to Q3-4, skip 5 and go to 6. 

**If no**:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Question 3**:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want this President to be elected by a two-thirds majority vote during a joint sitting of the Parliament, or would you prefer one elected by an instant-runoff vote (IRV) during a joint sitting of the Parliament?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**If (1)**:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Question 4**:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Parliament cannot reach a two-thirds majority vote on anyone, do you support them using IRV to decide instead?

**Question 5**

Assuming the President is directly popularly elected, do you support using instant-runoff voting (IRV) to decide them?

**If no**:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Question 6**:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which alternate method would you prefer to be used to elect the directly, popularly-elected President: first-past-the-post (FPTP), with a single round; or, a two-round system?

**Question 7**

Do you want the President to also be head of Government, or would you prefer to keep the Prime Minister as head of Government instead?

**If (2)**:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Question 8**:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want the President to have power over the armed forces and foreign policy, or would you rather their role to be largely ceremonial? Regardless, they will still have the following *{% include wp.html link="reserve powers" %}*:

* The ability to dissolve the Parliament and call a new election, if and only if:

    * There is strong evidence of mass corruption, or other criminal misconduct in the Parliament or Government.
    * There is strong evidence the election was rigged.
    * The Government has broken its pre-election promises, in a deliberate, wilful way.
    * The Government has failed to meet its constitutional obligations, such as in securing supply.

* The ability to do whatever is needed to defend the Constitution from the Government, or Parliament, but if their act is without precedence, they must ask the High Court whether (1) it is legal and (2) whether it is appropriate. If and only if they say yes to both, they may proceed. 

* The ability to temporarily veto legislation&mdash;if they believe the bill is legally invalid&mdash;pending a review by the HC.

* The ability to dismiss the Government and install a caretaker Government, after dissolving the Parliament and calling a new election, if and only if:

    * There is strong evidence of mass corruption, or other criminal misconduct, among members of the Government. This evidence must be strong enough to practically ensure a conviction for at least three members of the Government, or ten members of the Parliament.
    * The Government has broken its pre-election promises, in a deliberate, wilful way. Note: this does *not* include failing to pass a bill that would have fulfilled a promise, due to too few people voting in favour of it. If the Government tried to pass a bill to a fulfil a promise, but it was defeated, like in the Senate, then that is not to be held against them.
    * They have violated the Constitution in a deliberate, wilful way. Merely failing to secure supply, as the opposition has blocked it, for example, does not count. nb. failing to secure supply is grounds for dissolving the Parliament, however. 

**Question 9**:

Do you want the President to need to have at least a Bachelor of Laws (LLB), with experience in Constitutional law specifically, so that we can be confident they know the Constitution and law well enough to know when it has been violated by the Government or Parliament?
