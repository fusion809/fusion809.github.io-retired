Citizen-initiated referenda
============================

I also propose giving citizens the ability to initiate a referendum by starting a petition that receives signatures from at least 10% of eligible voters within a twelve month period. These referenda should be binding on the Government, that is, if they receive 10% of signatures within twelve months the Government has to call the referendum. Likewise, if the referendum passes they have to implement the requested changes. 

The wording of the question to be given to voters will also be set in stone (as if it is edited at the last moment the referendum triggered may be quite different from the one the signatories and originator wanted), and uneditable by the Government before the referendum is called. The question's wording will be vetted by an attorney at the Governmental office wherein the petition is picked up and started. The attorney will work with the initiator on the wording; once they agree on the wording, a photocopy of the petition will be sent to the AG's office for their approval, and once the AG approves it, the petition will start circulating. If the AG does not approve the wording, the AG and the initiator of the referendum will discuss the wording until they agree on it.  The purpose of this vetting process is in case the initiator of the referendum proposes a change that cannot be legally implemented, or asks a question that is very vague and due to its ambiguity, cannot be implemented.
