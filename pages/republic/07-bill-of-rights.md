===============

A bill of rights to be introduced into the federal Constitution. Such a Constitution would safeguard:

* Freedom of speech&mdash;only limits will be on libel (purposeful destruction of someone's reputation using false allegations; burden of proof on the falsity of the claims will be on the plaintiff), speech that endangers citizens (e.g. yelling fire in a crowded theatre, as it can lead to people being trampled) or national security (e.g. revealing military secrets).
* Freedom of expression&mdash;to prevent any possible banning of symbols like the swastika, hammer and sickle, or even Nazi salutes, regardless of how we feel about them. 
* Freedom of association&mdash;to forbid any future attempt to ban a political party. 
* Freedom of information&mdash;to ensure that all Government reports that do not touch on matters of national security, or other sensitive matters (e.g. information about private citizens, that have not been convicted of a crime that the report relates to), are made publicly available. For example, if a drug company has applied for drug approval this fact and any decisions by the TGA will be made public.
* Right of adults to make decisions that only impact on themselves. If you would like to take recreational drugs, that is your right. If you commit a crime while under the influence you will be legally barred from using that as an excuse for your crime. 
* *Habeus corpus*&mdash;everyone has the right to demand to be brought before a court and argue the legality of their detainment. If it is impossible to bring them before a court within an hour of this demand, the police have to let them go. Maximum detainment without charge will be twenty four hours.
* One's rights against cruel and unusual punishment. 
* Right to feel safe, to safeguard prisoners from abuse in prison. If someone is imprisoned the state is responsible (and can be sued for failure to safeguard) for their safety. No one should be raped, or assaulted in prison, regardless of crime. After all, if they are abused in there, how likely is it that they will come out of prison even more dangerous to society, and perhaps even completely useless to it (unable to work, for example)?
* Right to life. Capital punishment is already illegal nationwide, but we should probably prevent it from ever being legalized.
