Appointment method
===================

I want the head of state to have reason for upholding the will of the people more than the will of the Parliament, so I think a directly elected head of state is the way to go. I want this accountability to the people because that way the head of state will be incentivized to call an early election if the Government too happily breaks its pre-election promises (per the [head of state powers](#Head-of-state-powers) section).

<h2 style="background-color: white; border:none;" id="requirements-for-head-of-state">Requirements for the head of state</h2>
The head of state will need to meet the requirements to be a parliamentarian, e.g. not be a dual citizen, and they will also need to have no significant links to political parties and politicians (e.g. if they have a family member they have little to do with that is a politician they will not necessarily be disqualified), nor can they have any ties with big business. 

<h2 style="background-color: white; border: none;" id="nomination">Nomination</h2>
Unless a new election is called abnormally early (e.g. due to impeachment), each candidate _must_ be nominated by three months before the election. Before I proceed to detail the nomination mechanisms, any petitioned used in the head of state nominated process must meet the following conditions:

1. it must not have started circulating any more than 5 years ago;
2. it must only nominated one person; and
3. it must be signed by the nominated person, with this signature indicating their agreement to run in the head of state election if nominated and serve as head of state if elected for the full term length. If they drop out of the race, or they resign from the post of head of state (if they are elected, of course), then they must either pay a fine (which will be dependent on how much their dropping out or resignation is likely to cost the taxpayer) or present an acceptable reason for their dropping out or resignation to the Commonwealth Parliament.

There would be four means by which head of state candidates could be nominated:

<ol>
<li>Each of the state and territory parliaments will be required to nominate a single candidate each. Voters will be free to petition their local parliament. Voters eligible to sign these petitions are those that are registered and eligible to vote in federal elections within the state or territory in question.<br/><br/>

If a single petition is handed into them with signatures from 50%+1 of eligible voters then the parliament <i>must</i> nominate that candidate; no actual vote in parliament is required. If petitions for more than two candidates that represent an aggregate total of fewer than 2/3rds of eligible voters are handed into the parliament, then while it would be prudent for the parliament to select from among the candidates, they are not obliged to. If <i>n</i> petitions are handed into the parliament, with signatures from an aggregate total of over <i>100n/(n+1)</i>% (e.g. if n=2, it would be >66.66..% of eligible voters, while if n=3 it would be >75% of eligible voters, <i>etc.</i>) of eligible voters, then the parliament <i>must</i> nominate one of the petitioned candidates; a simple majority vote in both houses or at a joint sitting is required in this case. If the parliament cannot reach a majority vote on any of the available candidates, then full preferential voting will be used to decide the winner.</li>
<li>An Electoral College of the local government councils of the territories that do not have their own parliaments (e.g. Christmas, Cocos, Jervis Bay and Norfolk) <i>can</i> nominate a candidate on behalf of these territories, although they are only obliged to if they receive at least one petition that has received signatures from at least 10% of eligible voters registered to vote in federal elections in these territories. Otherwise, everything that applies to state and territory parliament nominations also apply to Electoral College nominations (e.g. the influence of petitions over the process).</li>
<li>Self-nomination, but only if they have served as head of state before and have <i>not</i> been defeated in any subsequent head of state elections.</li>
<li>By a petition that has received signatures from at least 10% of eligible voters from across the country in the past 3 years.</li>
</ol>

<h2 style="background-color: white; border: none;" id="elections">Elections</h2>
Head of state elections would be conducted simultaneously to House of Representatives (HoR) elections and the maximum term length will be the same as that of the HoR (presently three years). The simultaneous elections are to serve multiple purposes: to minimize cost, maximize turnout, minimize inconvenience, and to maximize accountability for the use of reserve powers over the Parliament.
