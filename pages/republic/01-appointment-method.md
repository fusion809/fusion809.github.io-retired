Appointment method
===================

I want the head of state to have reason for upholding the will of the people more than the will of the Parliament, so I think a directly elected head of state is still the way to go. I want this accountability to the people because that way the head of state will be incentivized to call an early election if the Government too happily breaks its pre-election promises (per the [head of state powers](#Head-of-state-powers) section).
