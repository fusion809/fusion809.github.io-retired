Appointment method
===================

<h2 style="background-color: white; border:none;" id="requirements-for-head-of-state">Requirements for the head of state</h2>
The head of state will need to meet the requirements to be a parliamentarian, e.g. not be a dual citizen, and they cannot be a member of a political party, nor can they have any ties with big business. 

<h2 style="background-color: white; border: none;" id="nomination">Nomination</h2>
Unless a new election is called abnormally early (e.g. due to impeachment), each candidate _must_ be nominated by three months before the election. Before I proceed to detail the nomination mechanisms, any petitioned used in the head of state nominated process must meet the following conditions:

1. it must not have started circulating any more than 5 years ago;
2. it must only nominate one person; and
3. it must be signed by the nominated person, with this signature indicating their agreement to run in the head of state election if nominated and serve as head of state if elected for the full term length. If they drop out of the race, or they resign from the post of head of state (if they are elected, of course), then they must either pay a fine (which will be dependent on how much their dropping out or resignation is likely to cost the taxpayer) or present an acceptable reason for their dropping out or resignation to the Commonwealth Parliament.

There would be four means by which head of state candidates could be nominated:

<ol>
<li>Each of the state and territory parliaments will be required to nominate a single candidate each. Voters will be free to petition their local parliament. Voters eligible to sign these petitions are those that are registered and eligible to vote in federal elections within the state or territory in question.<br/><br/>

If a single petition is handed into them with signatures from 50%+1 of eligible voters then the parliament <i>must</i> nominate that candidate; no actual vote in parliament is required. If petitions for more than two candidates that represent an aggregate total of fewer than 2/3rds of eligible voters are handed into the parliament, then while it would be prudent for the parliament to select from among the candidates, they are not obliged to. If <i>n</i> petitions are handed into the parliament, with signatures from an aggregate total of over <i>100n/(n+1)</i>% (e.g. if n=2, it would be >66.66..% of eligible voters, while if n=3 it would be >75% of eligible voters, <i>etc.</i>) of eligible voters, then the parliament <i>must</i> nominate one of the petitioned candidates; a simple majority vote in both houses or at a joint sitting is required in this case. If the parliament cannot reach a majority vote on any of the available candidates, then full preferential voting will be used to decide the winner.<br/><br/>

If no binding petition is before the parliament, a three-quarter majority vote in both houses of the parliament will be required to nominate any candidate. That candidate will need to meet additional requirements, unless they were nominated by a non-binding petition with the signatures of at least 10% of eligible voters collected within the last 5 years, namely they will need to not have any links to big business or political parties.</li>
<li>An Electoral College of the local government councils of the territories that do not have their own parliaments (e.g. Christmas, Cocos, Jervis Bay and Norfolk) <i>can</i> nominate a candidate on behalf of these territories, although they are only obliged to if they receive at least one petition that has received signatures from at least 10% of eligible voters registered to vote in federal elections in these territories within the past five years. Otherwise, everything that applies to state and territory parliament nominations also apply to Electoral College nominations (e.g. the influence of petitions over the process).</li>
<li>Self-nomination, but only if they have served as head of state or Governor-General before and have <i>not</i> been defeated in any subsequent head of state elections.</li>
<li>By a petition that has received signatures from at least 10% of eligible voters from across the country in the past 5 years.</li>
</ol>

<h2 style="background-color: white; border: none;" id="elections">Elections</h2>
The head of state will serve for fixed six-year terms, with an attempt made to make their elections lined up with House of Representatives elections. The simultaneous elections are to serve multiple purposes: to minimize cost, maximize turnout and minimize inconvenience.
