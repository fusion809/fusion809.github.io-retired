Other criminal reforms
======================

Prison should focus on rehabilitation, and prevention of reoffending, not merely punishment, as the best justice we can give victims is to reduce the odds that such a crime will occur again. By giving longer prison sentences, or not fully rehabilitating them, we are, in essence, punishing society for their crimes as well, as we increase the time they are inside and while they are in prison they are simply a burden on society (we are responsible for their healthcare, food, water, housing, _etc._), but when they are out, they are not necessarily a burden. We should also minimize which jobs they are forever barred from. For example, presently criminals cannot be (correct me if I am wrong):

* judges,
* police officers,
* lawyers,
* physicians,
* surgeons,
* teachers,
* jurors,
* politicians (to some extent)

each of which provide essential services to society, and everyone of them, except for jurors, pay taxes, which is of benefit to society.
