The {% include wp.html link="Commonwealth of Australia" art="Australia" f="b" %} has a rather unique political system that is not found in any other country. Most of its elements are taken from two other federations that were present at the time of its founding and still exist today&mdash;{% include wp.html link="Canada" puncr="," %} and the {% include wp.html link="United States" %} (US). Its elements taken from Canada are mostly those borrowed from the former British Empire; they are not taken directly from the {% include wp.html link="British Empire" %} because it had no written constitution, while Canada has. Due to its unique blend of {% include wp.html link="Westminster" art="Westminster_system" %} and American (or Washington) elements it is often referred to as the Washminster (a {% include wt.html link="portmanteau" art="portmanteau_word" word-class="Noun" %} of Washington and Westminster) system or mutation. It was the first country in the world to be founded with the direct consent of the people as a whole, that was obtained by {% include wp.html link="referendum" puncr="," %} instead of merely the consent of the ruling elite.
