{% include_relative nexus-5x-specs.html %}

{% include wp.html link="Nexus 5X" f="b" %} was at the time of its release on 22 October 2015, Google's flagship smartphone. Its out of the box installation of Android is upgradeable to version 8.1, which while still supported, is unlikely to be for much longer and Nexus 5X has official unlocking instructions&mdash;both of these factors combine to make Nexus 5X an attractive phone to install third-party operating systems to. The following operating systems support Nexus 5X:

* {% include wp.html link="KDE neon" %} with the Plasma Mobile user interface&mdash;a GNU/Linux distribution. This operating system is likely to receive continuous updates until a new phone becomes the focus of this open-source project. 
* {% include wp.html link="LineageOS" %}&mdash;an open-source, security-, customization- and privacy-focused Android ROM. Latest version available for Nexus 5X, at the time of writing, is 15.1 (based on Android 8.1), while for many other devices LineageOS 16.0 (based on Android 9.0) is available.
* {% include wp.html link="Pixel Experience" %}&mdash;an Android ROM that attempts to reproduce the version of Android present on Pixel phones, this includes the Google apps and Pixel extras present on this line of phones. At the time of writing, the latest version of this ROM that is available for Nexus 5X is 9.0 (based on Android 9.0).
