In 1999, Australians voted in a {% include wp.html art="1999_Australian_republic_referendum" link="referendum" %} on whether Australia should become a republic with a president elected by a two-thirds majority vote in Parliament. This proposal was defeated, and one reason given for why was that voters were not in favour of the specific proposal. Some were in favour of a popularly elected president instead.

Appointment method
===================

I was actually in favour of the president being directly elected, but then I realized that if the president is meant to be an independent referee, then what's the point to making it a popularity contest? Like, what are their campaigns going to be based on? Their political attitudes? As, if it is based on their political attitudes, then we'd be electing someone with an inherent bias with regards to the various parties (favouring the party they are either in, or most agree with the policies of), which is precisely what the president is not meant to have.

A president being nominated by the Attorney-General (AG), Prime Minister (PM) or Deputy PM (DPM), based on their legal qualifications (and hence ability to understand their constitutional obligations and what constitutes a constitutional violation they need to remedy) and impartiality, then confirmed by a two-thirds majority vote in Parliament, sounds like a decent method of selecting them. Although, what happens if the Parliament cannot agree on whom to elect? If such a system is implemented I propose using {% include wp.html link="instant-runoff voting" %} (IRV) to decide between candidates nominated by the AG, DPM and PM instead. 

But, I want the president to have reason for upholding the will of the people more than the will of the Parliament, so I think a directly elected president is still the way to go. I want this accountability to the people because that way the President will be incentivized to call an early election if the Government too happily breaks its pre-election promises (per the [Presidential powers](#presidential-powers) section).

Presidential powers
====================

Powers of such a president:

* The ability to dissolve the Parliament (either fully or in part) and call a new election (which must be held within a month of this dissolution) in the event of:

    - The Government failing to meet its constitutional obligations, like securing supply.

    - The Government breaking many of its pre-election promises. Not being able to fulfil their promises due to their bills not being approved by the Parliament is not valid grounds. If they do not even attempt to introduce the bills they promised, or if they start doing things they promised they would not do (e.g. dismantling Medicare, educational services, etc.), then that is valid grounds for the Parliament to be dissolved.

    - Evidence of mass corruption in the Parliament, or Government.

    In this event, the president will have the right to turn any pending appropriation bills into temporary law, that can be reversed by the new Parliament, once it is formed and convened for the first time, if they so desire. If, and only if, an emergency occurs that requires urgent legislation, the president will also have the power to draft a bill, and if after the High Court (HC) has examined it for faults (as there is not a full Parliament to do so, after all) and ruled it valid, the ministers of state vote in favour of it, it can be written into temporary law. This law will be reviewed by the new Parliament on its first sitting; if they agree with the law and vote in favour of it, it will formally become an Act of Parliament, making it no longer temporary. 

* Dismiss the Government and install a caretaker government, if any only if, there is evidence of mass corruption in the Government.  

* Defending the Constitution, via any means necessary. If they intend to do so via an action without precedence, they need to get the HC's approval on the legality of their action and whether the HC believes their action is appropriate. If the HC believes their proposal is inappropriate, then the HC may offer their own. 

* They can dismiss ministers of state, including the Prime Minister (PM), along with MPs and senators, if and only if, they have been convicted of corruption or misbehaviour. If there is evidence of corruption or misconduct, but they have not been convicted yet, the president will be able to temporarily dismiss them, pending the completion of the investigation, from their ministerial positions, but not their seats in the Parliament. 

* Temporarily vetoing legislation, pending a review of it by the HC, if they feel the legislation is legally invalid (e.g. if it is unconstitutional).

***Note**: they will not give assent to legislation, or have the ability to appoint any officials, or be commander-in-chief of the armed forces, or have any additional executive powers. These powers will be firmly vested in the ministers of state and the Parliament. The Governor-General (GG), by convention, almost always follows the advice of ministers of state when the GG exercises their executive powers, but there is no guarantee a future president will follow this convention if we transfer this power and convention to them, so it is prudent to limit what power they do have.*

Citizen-initiated referenda
============================

I also propose giving citizens the ability to initiate a referendum by starting a petition that receives signatures from at least 10% of eligible voters within a twelve month period. These referenda should be binding on the Government, that is, if they receive 10% of signatures within twelve months the Government has to call the referendum. Likewise, if the referendum passes they have to implement the requested changes. 

The wording of the question to be given to voters will also be set in stone (as if it is edited at the last moment the referendum triggered may be quite different from the one the signatories and originator wanted), and uneditable by the Government before the referendum is called. The question's wording will be vetted by an attorney at the governmental office wherein the petition is picked up and started. The attorney will work with the initiator on the wording; once they agree on the wording, a photocopy of the petition will be sent to the AG's office for their approval, and once the AG approves it, the petition will start circulating. If the AG does not approve the wording, the AG and the initiator of the referendum will discuss the wording until they agree on it.  The purpose of this vetting process is in case the initiator of the referendum proposes a change that cannot be legally implemented, or asks a question that is very vague and due to its ambiguity, cannot be implemented. 

Electorate meetings
====================

Likewise, I propose allowing citizens the ability to call an **electorate meeting**, using a petition that receives signatures from 10% of eligible voters within the electorate within a six month period. In these meetings every eligible voter within the electorate is allowed to join in discussions about whether the MP or senator the meeting is about has been meeting their obligations to them. Whether they have broken any pre-election promises, whether they have behaved in a way contrary to their interests, *etc.* Due to the sizes of some electorates we should allow people to remotely attend using technology as well (e.g. Skype). A weeks notice will be necessary before the meeting, which will be held early during a Saturday night (as it tends to be most convenient to people, from a work point of view). 

At the end everyone will be given the chance to retake the vote that appointed the MP/senator in question in the first place. They will assign preferences, with all the candidates that were running in the original election available as options, and then using IRV or STV the winner(s) will be decided. If the person the meeting is about loses by a significant margin (that will be decided based on the percentage of eligible voters that are present at the meeting), a new election will be called. But, the candidate elected in this possible re-election will only serve out the rest of the term that their predecessor started (i.e. when the next federal election is called their seat will also be up for re-election).

{% include wp.html link="Senate" art="Australian_Senate" %} terms
=============

Senate terms should also be reduced in length, with their elections occurring at the same time as House elections. Why? Because, hopefully by doing this the House and Senate will have a more similar composition. 

Electoral system
=================

If my electorate meetings proposed change is not made, then the {% include wp.html art="Australian_House_of_Representatives" link="House of Representatives" %} should be elected using {% include wp.html link="mixed-member proportional representation" f="b" %} (**MMPR**), with most candidates elected from single member constituencies using {% include wp.html link="instant-runoff voting" puncr="," %} but some being appointed based on the percentage of votes being cast nationwide in favour of them (if they are an independent) or their party (the amount depends on how many are necessary to achieve roughly proportional representation). If a party/independent does not receive enough votes for them to win a seat their votes will be passed on to second preferences, if that second preference does not get in either, then they will pass to the third preference and so forth. Likewise, if a party receives more votes than necessary to get them the number of seats they end up getting, their excess votes will be transferred to their next preference, if they get an excess the votes will transfer to the next preference and so forth. The {% include wp.html art="Party-list_proportional_representation" link="party list" %} component will be {% include wp.html art="Open_list" link="open" puncr="," %} with each independent listed as a different option on the list. 

{% include wp.html link="Queensland" %} reforms
===================

Any amendment to [Queensland's Constitution](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/pdf/2002-06-06/act-2001-080) should require a referendum, not only those covered in [section 53 of the original Act](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/pdf/2002-06-06/act-2001-080#G3.1015016), as it is such a fundamental Act that it should be protected from unpopular, or poorly thought out edits.
