In 1999, Australians voted in a {% include wp.html art="1999_Australian_republic_referendum" link="referendum" %} on whether Australia should become a republic with a President elected by a two-thirds majority vote in Parliament. This proposal was defeated, and one reason given for why was that voters were not in favour of the specific proposal. Some were in favour of a popularly elected President instead.

{% include wp.html link="Bill of rights" %}
===============

A bill of rights to be introduced into the federal Constitution. Such a Constitution would safeguard:

* Freedom of speech&mdash;only limits will be on libel (purposeful destruction of someone's reputation using false allegations; burden of proof on the falsity of the claims will be on the plaintiff), speech that endangers citizens (e.g. yelling fire in a crowded theatre, as it can lead to people being trampled) or national security (e.g. revealing military secrets).
* Freedom of expression&mdash;to prevent any possible banning of symbols like the swastika, hammer and sickle, or even Nazi salutes, regardless of how we feel about them. 
* Freedom of association&mdash;to forbid any future attempt to ban a political party. 
* Freedom of information&mdash;to ensure that all Government reports that do not touch on matters of national security, or other sensitive matters (e.g. information about private citizens, that have not been convicted of a crime that the report relates to), are made publicly available. For example, if a drug company has applied for drug approval this fact and any decisions by the TGA will be made public.
* Right of adults to make decisions that only impact on themselves. If you would like to take recreational drugs, that is your right. If you commit a crime while under the influence you will be legally barred from using that as an excuse for your crime. 
* *Habeus corpus*&mdash;everyone has the right to demand to be brought before a court and argue the legality of their detainment. If it is impossible to bring them before a court within an hour of this demand, the police have to let them go. Maximum detainment without charge will be twenty four hours.
* One's rights against cruel and unusual punishment. 
* Right to feel safe, to safeguard prisoners from abuse in prison. If someone is imprisoned the state is responsible (and can be sued for failure to safeguard) for their safety. No one should be raped, or assaulted in prison, regardless of crime. After all, if they are abused in there, how likely is it that they will come out of prison even more dangerous to society, and perhaps even completely useless to it (unable to work, for example)?
* Right to life. Capital punishment is already illegal nationwide, but we should probably prevent it from ever being legalized. 

Attorney-General reform
=======================
The AG, and Shadow AG, must have at least an <abbr title="Bachelor of Laws">L.L.B.</abbr> degree and not be disqualified from any bar association (although, they do not need to be a member of one) due to any misbehaviour. By convention the AG and shadow AG are attorneys, but this is not a legal requirement. 

Justices of the High Court
===========================
The AG and Shadow AG should be required to meet and reach a consensus on whom to appoint to the HC as justices, when a new position opens up in the court. Why do both the AG and Shadow AG have to be involved in this nomination process? Because the HC justices are meant to be impartial and well-qualified for the job (having at least an <abbr title="Master of Laws">L.L.M.</abbr> degree and not having been disqualified from any bar association for misconduct), so leaving it to just the AG to nominate candidates sounds imprudent, as they will obviously have their own political biases, but if the two are forced to reach a consensus they will probably compromise on someone they can both agree are impartial and fit for the job. They should be required to write a list of at least five candidates per justice position available, which will then be presented to the Parliament to debate on, reach a consensus, or if that is not possible, vote using single transferable voting or instant-runoff voting (if only one justice needs to be selected). 

Other criminal reforms
======================

Prison should focus on rehabilitation, and prevention of reoffending, not merely punishment, as the best justice we can give victims is to reduce the odds that such a crime will occur again. By giving longer prison sentences, or not fully rehabilitating them, we are, in essence, punishing society for their crimes as well, as we increase the time they are inside and while they are in prison they are simply a burden on society (we are responsible for their healthcare, food, water, housing, _etc._), but when they are out, they are not necessarily a burden. We should also minimize which jobs they are forever barred from. For example, presently criminals cannot be:

* judges,
* police officers,
* lawyers,
* physicians,
* surgeons,
* teachers,
* jurors,
* politicians (to some extent)

each of which provide essential services to society, and everyone of them, except for jurors, pay taxes, which is of benefit to society. 

{% include wp.html link="Queensland" %} reforms
===================

Any amendment to [Queensland's Constitution](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/pdf/2002-06-06/act-2001-080) should require a referendum, not only those covered in [section 53 of the original Act](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/pdf/2002-06-06/act-2001-080#G3.1015016), as it is such a fundamental Act that it should be protected from unpopular, or poorly thought out amendments.
