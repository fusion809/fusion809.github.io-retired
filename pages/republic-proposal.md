In 1999, Australians voted in a {% include wp.html art="1999_Australian_republic_referendum" link="referendum" %} on whether Australia should become a republic with a President elected by a two-thirds majority vote in Parliament. This proposal was defeated, and one reason given for why was that voters were not in favour of the specific proposal. Some were in favour of a popularly elected President instead.

Citizen-initiated referenda
============================

I also propose giving citizens the ability to initiate a referendum by starting a petition that receives signatures from at least 10% of eligible voters within a twelve month period. These referenda should be binding on the Government, that is, if they receive 10% of signatures within twelve months the Government has to call the referendum. Likewise, if the referendum passes they have to implement the requested changes. 

The wording of the question to be given to voters will also be set in stone (as if it is edited at the last moment the referendum triggered may be quite different from the one the signatories and originator wanted), and uneditable by the Government before the referendum is called. The question's wording will be vetted by an attorney at the Governmental office wherein the petition is picked up and started. The attorney will work with the initiator on the wording; once they agree on the wording, a photocopy of the petition will be sent to the AG's office for their approval, and once the AG approves it, the petition will start circulating. If the AG does not approve the wording, the AG and the initiator of the referendum will discuss the wording until they agree on it.  The purpose of this vetting process is in case the initiator of the referendum proposes a change that cannot be legally implemented, or asks a question that is very vague and due to its ambiguity, cannot be implemented. 

Electorate meetings
====================

Likewise, I propose allowing citizens the ability to call an **electorate meeting**, using a petition that receives signatures from 10% of eligible voters within the electorate within a six month period. In these meetings every eligible voter within the electorate is allowed to join in discussions about whether the MP or senator the meeting is about has been meeting their obligations to them. Whether they have broken any pre-election promises, whether they have behaved in a way contrary to their interests, *etc.* Due to the sizes of some electorates we should allow people to remotely attend using technology as well (e.g. Skype). A weeks notice will be necessary before the meeting, which will be held early during a Saturday night (as it tends to be most convenient to people, from a work point of view). 

At the end everyone will be given the chance to retake the vote that appointed the MP/senator in question in the first place. They will assign preferences, with all the candidates that were running in the original election available as options, and then using IRV or STV the winner(s) will be decided. If the person the meeting is about loses by a significant margin (that will be decided based on the percentage of eligible voters that are present at the meeting), a new election will be called. But, the candidate elected in this possible re-election will only serve out the rest of the term that their predecessor started (i.e. when the next federal election is called their seat will also be up for re-election).

{% include wp.html link="Senate" art="Australian_Senate" %} terms
=============

Senate terms should also be reduced in length, with their elections occurring at the same time as House elections. Why? Because, hopefully by doing this the House and Senate will have a more similar composition. 

Electoral system
=================

If my electorate meetings proposed change is not made, then the {% include wp.html art="Australian_House_of_Representatives" link="House of Representatives" %} should be elected using {% include wp.html link="mixed-member proportional representation" f="b" %} (**MMPR**), with most candidates elected from single member constituencies using {% include wp.html link="instant-runoff voting" puncr="," %} but some being appointed based on the percentage of votes being cast nationwide in favour of them (if they are an independent) or their party (the amount depends on how many are necessary to achieve roughly proportional representation). If a party/independent does not receive enough votes for them to win a seat their votes will be passed on to second preferences, if that second preference does not get in either, then they will pass to the third preference and so forth. Likewise, if a party receives more votes than necessary to get them the number of seats they end up getting, their excess votes will be transferred to their next preference, if they get an excess the votes will transfer to the next preference and so forth. The {% include wp.html art="Party-list_proportional_representation" link="party list" %} component will be {% include wp.html art="Open_list" link="open" puncr="," %} with each independent listed as a different option on the list. 

{% include wp.html link="Bill of rights" %}
===============

A bill of rights to be introduced into the federal Constitution. Such a Constitution would safeguard:

* Freedom of speech&mdash;only limits will be on libel (purposeful destruction of someone's reputation using false allegations; burden of proof on the falsity of the claims will be on the plaintiff), speech that endangers citizens (e.g. yelling fire in a crowded theatre, as it can lead to people being trampled) or national security (e.g. revealing military secrets).
* Freedom of expression&mdash;to prevent any possible banning of symbols like the swastika, hammer and sickle, or even Nazi salutes, regardless of how we feel about them. 
* Freedom of association&mdash;to forbid any future attempt to ban a political party. 
* Freedom of information&mdash;to ensure that all Government reports that do not touch on matters of national security, or other sensitive matters (e.g. information about private citizens, that have not been convicted of a crime that the report relates to), are made publicly available. For example, if a drug company has applied for drug approval this fact and any decisions by the TGA will be made public.
* Right of adults to make decisions that only impact on themselves. If you would like to take recreational drugs, that is your right. If you commit a crime while under the influence you will be legally barred from using that as an excuse for your crime. 
* *Habeus corpus*&mdash;everyone has the right to demand to be brought before a court and argue the legality of their detainment. If it is impossible to bring them before a court within an hour of this demand, the police have to let them go. Maximum detainment without charge will be twenty four hours.
* One's rights against cruel and unusual punishment. 
* Right to feel safe, to safeguard prisoners from abuse in prison. If someone is imprisoned the state is responsible (and can be sued for failure to safeguard) for their safety. No one should be raped, or assaulted in prison, regardless of crime. After all, if they are abused in there, how likely is it that they will come out of prison even more dangerous to society, and perhaps even completely useless to it (unable to work, for example)?
* Right to life. Capital punishment is already illegal nationwide, but we should probably prevent it from ever being legalized. 

Attorney-General reform
=======================
The AG, and Shadow AG, must have at least an <abbr title="Bachelor of Laws">L.L.B.</abbr> degree and not be disqualified from any bar association (although, they do not need to be a member of one) due to any misbehaviour. By convention the AG and shadow AG are attorneys, but this is not a legal requirement. 

Justices of the High Court
===========================
The AG and Shadow AG should be required to meet and reach a consensus on whom to appoint to the HC as justices, when a new position opens up in the court. Why do both the AG and Shadow AG have to be involved in this nomination process? Because the HC justices are meant to be impartial and well-qualified for the job (having at least an <abbr title="Master of Laws">L.L.M.</abbr> degree and not having been disqualified from any bar association for misconduct), so leaving it to just the AG to nominate candidates sounds imprudent, as they will obviously have their own political biases, but if the two are forced to reach a consensus they will probably compromise on someone they can both agree are impartial and fit for the job. They should be required to write a list of at least five candidates per justice position available, which will then be presented to the Parliament to debate on, reach a consensus, or if that is not possible, vote using single transferable voting or instant-runoff voting (if only one justice needs to be selected). 

Other criminal reforms
======================

Prison should focus on rehabilitation, and prevention of reoffending, not merely punishment, as the best justice we can give victims is to reduce the odds that such a crime will occur again. By giving longer prison sentences, or not fully rehabilitating them, we are, in essence, punishing society for their crimes as well, as we increase the time they are inside and while they are in prison they are simply a burden on society (we are responsible for their healthcare, food, water, housing, _etc._), but when they are out, they are not necessarily a burden. We should also minimize which jobs they are forever barred from. For example, presently criminals cannot be:

* judges,
* police officers,
* lawyers,
* physicians,
* surgeons,
* teachers,
* jurors,
* politicians (to some extent)

each of which provide essential services to society, and everyone of them, except for jurors, pay taxes, which is of benefit to society. 

{% include wp.html link="Queensland" %} reforms
===================

Any amendment to [Queensland's Constitution](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/pdf/2002-06-06/act-2001-080) should require a referendum, not only those covered in [section 53 of the original Act](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/pdf/2002-06-06/act-2001-080#G3.1015016), as it is such a fundamental Act that it should be protected from unpopular, or poorly thought out amendments.
