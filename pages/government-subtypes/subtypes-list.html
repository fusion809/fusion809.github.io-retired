                <li><b>Full presidential system</b>, where no members of the cabinet are members of the legislature. e.g. the {% include wp.html link="United States" art="Politics_of_the_United_States" puncr="." %} The president is head of the executive and is either directly elected, or indirectly by an {% include wp.html link="Electoral College" puncr="." %} </li>
                <li><b>Largely presidential system</b>, where members of the cabinet, aside from the president, are largely members of the legislature as well. They are also accountable to the legislature and can be dismissed by it. But the president can also dismiss them and appoints them without legislative confirmation. There is no prime ministerial position, as the president is also head of government. The president is elected directly by the voters of the country and cannot be dismissed by the legislature. The chief extant example is {% include wp.html link="Zimbabwe" art="Politics_of_Zimbabwe" puncr="." %}</li>
                <li><b>Presidential system where the president is elected by the legislature</b>, but thereafter not accountable to it. For example, a vote of no confidence does not lead to their dismissal. {% include wp.html link="Suriname" art="Politics_of_Suriname" %} is the best example, although some have called it a parliamentary system, just with minimal checks and balances. </li>
                <li>{% include wp.html link="Directorial system" f="b" puncr="," %} where a board of people elected by the legislature simultaneously serve as both head of state and head of government. Members of the executive serve for fixed terms and cannot be dismissed by no confidence votes. Examples include: {% include wp.html link="San Marino" %} and {% include wp.html link="Switzerland" puncr="." %}</li>

                <li>{% include wp.html link="President-parliamentarism" puncr="," f="b" %} a subtype of semi-presidential system where the directly elected president not only appoints the cabinet members, but can dismiss them, and they can also be dismissed by the legislature. The PM is technically the head of government and serves as chairman of the cabinet. Taiwan, the Weimar Republic and Russia are prime examples.</li>
                <li>{% include wp.html link="Premier-presidentialism" puncr="," f="b" %} another subtype of semi-presidentialism, except where the directly elected president cannot dismiss the ministers on their own and usually has limited power over the legislature.

                <li><b>Parliamentary system with a fused head of state and head of government position</b> that is dependent on parliamentary confidence in order to remain in office. They are also elected by the legislature and sometimes also have a seat in it. Botswana, Nauru and South Africa are perhaps the best examples, although in Botswana's case a vote of no confidence does not automatically lead to the head of government's dismissal, but if they do not resign it automatically triggers the dissolution of the Parliament after a certain amount of time.</li>
                <li>{% include wp.html link="Semi-parliamentarism" puncr="," f="b" %} where either: (1) the head of government is elected directly by the voters (e.g. Israel prior to 2001), but is accountable to the legislature; or (2) the legislature is bicameral, with both houses directly elected and the government only being accountable to one of those two houses (e.g. Australia's federal government, along with the state governments of three out of six states, namely&mdash;South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia, and the national government of Japan).</li>
                <li><b>Non-Westminster parliamentary system</b>, where members of the executive are not members of the parliament, but are accountable to it. In these systems where is more "separation of powers" than there is in Westminster systems.</li>
                <li><b>Disintermediated Westminster system</b>, where the theoretical powers of the head of state/their representative are markedly reduced, with most of their powers placed directly in the hands of the ministers. Examples include Ireland, Israel and Japan.</li>
                <li>{% include wp.html link="Westminster system" puncr="," f="b" %} where members of the executive are not only accountable to the legislature, but are members of it as well. The head of state/their representative have complete executive power, although based on convention they only exercise their powers on the advice of the ministers and, in some cases, the parliament. In the original Westminster system, the United Kingdom, there was parliamentary sovereignty too, although it is debatable whether this is truly the case any more.</li>
