A {% include wp.html f="b" art="Presidential_system" link="presidential system" %} is a republican system of government that features a president that leads an executive branch that is separate from both the legislative and judicial branches. The legislature in such systems is usually referred to as a Congress. The original and most notable example of a presidential system is that of the United States. 

While these systems have a fairly clean separation between the three branches each branch usually has some power over the others. For example, in the US the President can veto legislation passed by the Congress, although the Congress can override this veto if both houses of the Congress vote in a two-thirds majority in favour of the legislation. Likewise, justices of the Supreme Court are appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate. The Congress can also remove the President by impeachment, although only if the President commits "high crimes and misdemeanors."
