## XBPS
[**XBPS**](https://wiki.voidlinux.eu/XBPS) is the default package manager of Void Linux. It is somewhat similar to pacman in that its syntax is &ldquo;simple&rdquo; in its own way and resembles that of pacman, although unlike pacman which has just one command (`pacman`) that is used for most things, XBPS has several different commands that are used routinely by most users (e.g. `xbps-install`, `xbps-query`, `xbps-remove`, *etc.*). XBPS is also similar to pacman in the sense that it is written mostly in C and is blazing fast, although not quite as fast as pacman itself. [According to GitHub](https://github.com/voidlinux/xbps/graphs/contributors) its first commit was made in mid 2009. 

Its packages have the `.xbps` file extension and are generated using xbps-src script found in the [GitHub repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/voidlinux/void-packages/master/xbps-src) used to store the packaging source files of Void Linux's packages. Void Linux has several repositories, and while they are far smaller than Arch's they are still pretty comprehensive. 

### Beginner-Friendliness
Like pacman XBPS has a fairly unintuitive syntax and no official graphical front-end. In fact to my knowledge there's no graphical front-end at all available for XBPS. I would argue it is somewhat more intuitive than pacman's, as to install a package you use {% include Code/coders.html puncr="," line1="xbps-install package" %} while to uninstall it you use {% include Code/coders-fs.html line1="xbps-remove package" %} To upgrade all packages on one's system one uses {% include Code/coders.html line1="xbps-install -Su" puncr="," %} while to query databases
