**Programming languages** are the most important tools of any software developer or computer programmer, without them software development and computer programming, as it we know it, would not be possible. This post started out as a section of the glossary of the [*A Comparison of Free Operating Systems*](/comparison-of-free-operating-systems/) post, but I have decided to make it a whole new post. I should mention, however, that my programming knowledge is in its infancy (mostly limited to some Bash, MATLAB/GNU Octave and Python knowledge), so much of this post is based on external resources that I have read and digested into a (hopefully) coherent blog post.
