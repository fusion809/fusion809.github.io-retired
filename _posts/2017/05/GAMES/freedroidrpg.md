**FreedroidRPG** is a free and open-source, cross-platform role-playing game (RPG) wherein one plays as Tux to save the world from merciless robots, in a world ravaged by a conflict between robots and humans. I found myself stuck in its tutorial so I have not played the game all that much. Its graphics are isometric 3D and are of reasonable quality, not quite as high quality as RuneScape's NXT client or 0 A.D.
