**BZFlag** is a free and open-source, extremely cross-platform, 3D multiplayer tank battle game. In it the player is in one of the following five teams: blue, green, purple and red. Firing at the tanks of teammates, or being shot at oneself will loose one's team points, while shooting at enemy team tanks will earn the team points. There are also rogue tanks which are black in colour and they do not belong to any team and while they can shoot at other tanks, they do not gain any team points for doing so. There are two styles of play: capture-the-flag and free-for-all. In capture-the-flag each team, with at least one member, has a base and a team flag. The objective is to get the flags of other teams into your base. Moving an enemy flag into your base will destroy all members of that team, subtract from that team one point and add that point to your team score. In free-for-all there are no bases or flags, the objective is to merely get the highest score possible. 

While its graphics are 3D, they are fairly low-quality and similar to that of SuperTuxKart.
