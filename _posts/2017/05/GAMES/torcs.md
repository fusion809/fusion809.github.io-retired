**TORCS** is a free and open-source, 3D racing simulator game. The major difference between TORCS and SuperTuxKart are are that SuperTuxKart has a fictional theme to it as the various open-source project mascots are racing against one another and in it players can use weapons to slow their adversaries down. TORCS on the other hand, is designed to be as realistic as possible and it even includes stands where fans can watch the race and racers cannot use weapons against one another.
