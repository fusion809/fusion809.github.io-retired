My fellow Linux-using mathematics lovers rejoice, there's a [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/) 8.4 (the latest stable version at the moment) package, available via the [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix) package manager, that should work on any modern Linux distribution.

For those of you that do not know what Nix is, it is a cross-distribution package manager, that installs its packages to {% include Layouts/path.html path="/nix/store" %} (which means it does not conflict with the files installed by your distro's package manager) and sets up symlinks and environment variables to make its packages work properly on your system. It is possible to install multiple versions of the same package with it, and it is possible to revert packages to an older version with it, say, for example, if a bug appears in the newer version.

Nix can be installed on any Linux distribution, as well as macOS. There's a [quick install script](https://nixos.org/nix/install) that its website recommends using, with the simple command (read on after this before executing it, however!):

{% include Code/codeu.html line1="curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh" %}

(it will call sudo when super-user permissions are needed). I am sure many of you will see the security implications of this command: if the script's maintainers make a minor mess up in it, or their accounts get hacked and their hacker introduces malware into it, it is possible it could do real damage to one's system. Therefore, it is wise to download the script, inspect it, and then, if there are no problems with it, execute it. Using this script, Nix itself can be installed in under a minute. Then, after adding Nix's {% include Layouts/path.html path="~/.nix-profile/bin" %} directory to your user `PATH` variable, run:

{% include Code/codeu.html line1="nix-env -i sage" %}

(which does not need sudo privileges) to install SageMath. Be fair warned, this command will take a while to install it, as there are many dependencies it needs to install and it has a very tedious and CPU/RAM consuming test suite it goes through before being installed.

[GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/), [Julia](https://julialang.org/), [Scilab](http://scilab.org/) and [Maxima](http://maxima.sourceforge.net/) are also available via Nix, in fairly recent versions &mdash; 4.4.1 (the latest), 1.0.1 (a bug fix release behind the latest, 1.0.2), 6.0.1 (latest) and 5.41.0 (5.42.0 is the latest), respectively.
