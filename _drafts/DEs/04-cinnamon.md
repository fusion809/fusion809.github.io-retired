**Cinnamon** is an early fork of GNOME 3 developed soon after GNOME 3's release. I have used it to a moderate level extent, I have, in the past, used it as my primary desktop environment but I often gave it up as I did not think a network monitor graph was available for its panel. Recently I found that it did, in fact, have an applet to do this (system monitor with graphs). Cinnamon is a lot like its parent, GNOME 3, except unlike GNOME 3 it has a fairly "conventional" user interface that looks similar to Windows NT.

### Availability
Most distributions have Cinnamon in their official repositories. A list of some distributions with Cinnamon in their repositories can be found [here](https://pkgs.org/download/cinnamon). Note that it is not in the official repositories of Slackware. Gentoo Linux also has Cinnamon in their official repositories, as does Sabayon Linux. 

### Customizability
Like GNOME 3 it is extended using extensions written in JavaScript (JS) and is themed using style sheets in CSS or languages that transcompile to CSS. One advantage it has over GNOME 3 is that with GNOME 3 the way you install extensions is via going into a compatible web browser (usually Firefox) and installing it from within it by turning it "on" in the extensions store. With Cinnamon, however, these extensions can be installed using its own standalone graphical user interface, that is opened by right-clicking on the panel and selecting "Adding applets to the panel", or by right-clicking on the desktop background and selecting "Add desklets", depending on the type of extension you want.
