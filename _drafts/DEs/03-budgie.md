**Budgie** is somewhat similar to Unity in that is essentially just GNOME with only a few components different. See Budgie uses GNOME as its foundation, with most components managed upstream by the GNOME project, but what makes Budgie different from GNOME is that they replace *some* GNOME components with their own software. My exposure to it is limited to the occasional trials of it on Arch Linux and Solus VMs. A couple of years ago it was buggy on Arch Linux, but nowadays it is fairly stable, but its configuration options seem limited compared to those of GNOME.

### Availability
Relatively few modern distributions have Budgie in their official repositories. These include:
* Arch Linux
* Debian 9 and later
* openSUSE Tumbleweed
* Ubuntu 16.10 and later

### Beginner-friendliness
Budgie is configured graphically only and it is fairly beginner-friendly. I would rate its beginner-friendliness as being >8 out of 10. 

### Customizability
There are limited options for customization, namely you can:
* Pin programs to the panel
* Change desktop background
* Change GTK+ theme
* Change icon theme
* Change cursor theme
I would rate customizability as being 2&ndash;3 out of 10. 

### Stability
Nowadays it appears to be fairly stable. I would rate its stability as being 7&ndash;9 out of 10.

### System resource usage
Version 10.4 used 121.6 MiB RAM on Solus and took up 3.13 MiB disk space (not including its dependencies, of course).
