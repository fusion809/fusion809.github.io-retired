After some five years of looking for an operating system that suites me I have finally found my home and it is [**Gentoo Linux**](https://gentoo.org/). This is not to say it is perfect but it seems as close to perfect as I have found. While it can be challenging to install, it is still definitely worth it. In this post I will guide one through the installation process in a, hopefully, simple and informative manner and also discuss some useful advice to be used post-installation. Beware the Gentoo Wiki has a mighty fine [handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:Main_Page) to guide one through installation and some post-installation tasks, this article is designed to be an alternative take on it, with some simplification. Installing Gentoo for the first time took me a few tries before I succeeded, so I would suggest that you install it on a virtual machine before you try installing it to your hard disk. This is especially so because installing and setting up (including installing the set of software you will need for day-to-day use) Gentoo is quite tedious (can take a matter of days, or even weeks, depending on your processor speed) and if you make mistakes it can easily become even more tedious.
