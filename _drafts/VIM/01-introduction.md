I used to think that **Vim** was too complex for it to be of use to myself, I also thought that its lack of integrated terminal would be a deal-breaker for me. Fortunately its ability to execute shell commands and its sheer power, portability, speed and extensibility more than makes up for this shortcoming and it was easy enough for me to pick it up after using it as my default editor for a few months. In this overview I will review the history of Vim, the basics of using it, its shortcomings, availability on a wide variety of popular operating systems, how it compares to its major competitors and the basics of its scripting language Vim script (or VimL). Fortunately, I usually execute Vim in terminals so it is usually easy to access the command-line without Vim providing an embedded terminal.
